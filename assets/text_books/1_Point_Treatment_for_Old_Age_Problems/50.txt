(Sinoatrial node is the pacemaker of heart. It is situated in
the right atrium near the entrance of superior vena cava,
from which the impulses arise and spread to the other
part of the heart. In old age this pacemaker becomes weak
and can not function properly consequently the heart rate
falls abnormally. This is called sick sinus syndrome or
pacemaker syndrome : H 6a (R)T).
