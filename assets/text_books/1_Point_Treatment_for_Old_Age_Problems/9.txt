(The ability to think, perceive and remember are all
included in the general term "Cognitive Function". The
natural process of ageing means that our mind, like our
bodies, slow down some what and may not work as
efficiently as they once did.

A person with congnitive impairment can not carry out
daily activities, such as conversing, recognising familiar
faces or attending to personal needs. people over 80 are
most vulnerable : GV 207).
