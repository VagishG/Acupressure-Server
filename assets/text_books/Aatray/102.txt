From the above examples, it is clear that a point of mega meridian represents one-
tenth part of a part of any organ or eye, nose, ear, arms-legs or any one part of the body.
Therefore, one point is used in different rnannar in different states. As RMM point no. ‘1’ is
used in treatment of Larynx part of lungs and sclera part of right eye. By this a new energy
relation is established in different regions, organs and parts of the body. Relation of larynx
and sclera with RMM-1,shows the similarity in between energy levels of both these parts.
Hence, each cell of the body is surely related with some energy level. On this basis if any
patient has diabetes and he depends on medicine, then many related parts (pancreas-
liver- stomach- eye etc.) get affected and effect of medicine is limited.Cardiologist or
Orthopaedic, treats a region, but are they still unaware about this relation of energy of
acupressure and this subject of body and soul of man?

These acu-points of energy, contribute completely in recreation of the human-powers.
Itis possible to treat physical and mental problems easily through the medium of these acu-
points. The treatment of all these problems like heel pain, blocked artery, frozen knee,
headache, tension or insomnia is naturally present in the wrist of our hand in the form of
mega meridian. With the application of light pressure on them, the treatment starts itself by
the internal soul power (energy) of human-being. With this, we secure ourselves from oral
medicine or operation, etc.

Some successful examples of ten or twenty points of mega meridian have been
presented in the table given below: :
