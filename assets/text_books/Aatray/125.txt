(5) Relation Between Human Body and Mega Meridian

The anatomy of human body is a wonderful creation of God. This mortal body is made
up two hands, two legs, trunk, neck, head, fingers & toes, internal organs — lungs, heart,
stomach, kidneys, liver, urinary bladder, etc. of varying shapes and sizes. Scientists through
research have presented detailed information of blood vessels (arteries & veins), muscles,
bones, nerves, etc.

(A) Plotting of Chinese and Electro Acupuncture Meridians on Mega Meridians :

Adoctor of allopath, Dr. Reinold Voll of Germany, did a detailed research on Chinese
meridians and acupoints of acupressure. He studied the effects of points as a medicine on
the body parts while keeping the limitations of allopath in mind. He stated a relation in

.between allopathy and acupressure by the medium of his Electro- Acupuncture during his
work. He discovered the acu-points related to different parts of the body and tried to prove
by modern machines that the effect on the valves of heart is by pressing a certain point and
which point is used for the treatment of pace-maker; which point is related with appendix
and by which means piles can be cured by acupressure? He discovered some new
meridians during his studies. He discovered eight new tissue meridians by manifesting the
tissues of the body into meridians.

By the union of the oldest Chinese Philosophy of acupressure and Electro-Acupuncture
of modern age, there are ten energy lines in both sides of fingers and toes of hand-foot.
