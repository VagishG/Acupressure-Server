At first there was pain in the arm. Doctor treated for spondylitis by means of
traction and hot fomentation. After initial relief the pain occurred again within
a month. Doctor got the X-ray done and treated for cervical spondylitis again
by traction and fomentation. Within two weeks patients B. P. lowered and
complained of darkness in front of the eyes. Even the cardiologist was con-
sulted but all the reports were normal. There was no relief in arm and back
pain. The patient then first went to Marhwari Dharmashala for treatment and
felt better after three days application as suggested by M. K. Midha. After a
week the patient came to the Sansthan. Now points are applied twice a day.
After two months, 70% relief was reported
