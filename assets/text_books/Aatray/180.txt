On the basis of above diagram, each point of mega meridian have been divided into
ten branch point. Its sequence is presented on the basis of the principie of Homo- Hetero of
Sujok Therapy. Points of Homo energy 1, 4, 5, 8 are plotted towards the thumb side on both

Yin and Yang side of the palm and towards little finger (hetero) side 2, 3, 6, 7 branch points
are plotted.

These ten branch points are used in different types of disorders and at different levels.
In the previous pages, each one point of mega-meridian is joined with Chinese and Electro
Acupuncture meridians. Treatment of these meridians can be done easily by ten branch
points at one point of MM corresponding to one meridian.

Example - Point number 4 of RMM/LMM is related with Joint Degeneration Meridian.

Therefore, for the swelling, burning and dryness of the joint, treatment is on point 4 of RMM/
LMM and on its branch points 3 sedate, 4 tone.

So use of branch point of mega meridian is very useful. If identification of the energy
can not be done, then by pressing with the probe on ten points select the most painful point/
points for treatment among ten points and treat by applying methi or star/byol magnets.

Mainly all the meridian of arms and legs are plotted on mega meridians. On the basis
of the principle of Yin- Yang, Meridians of arms (because of yang) are on LMM and meridians

of legs (because of yin) will be on RMM. Using it according to the diagram given below,
gives most successful results.
