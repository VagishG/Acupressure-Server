(B) Sub Parts of the Brain on Mega Meridian :

i) Ten sub parts of the External Brain :

Two parts are found in external structure of the brain- Cerebral Hemisphere and Brain
Stem with Cerebellum. Cerebral Hemisphere or Cerebrum has four lobes- Frontal, Parietal,
Temporal and Occipital. These are divided separately into left and right cerebral -
hemispheres. Four lobes are in right cerebrum and four lobes are in left cerebrum. Main
functions of the cerebrum region of the brain are- thinking, creating new-thoughts, imagination
-etc. Therefore, its main energy is hetero or category of expansion. Just opposite to it, brain
stem and cerebellum have four parts- mid-brain, pons, Medulla and Cerebellum. These are
also divided in left and right hence eight parts. Main functions of these parts are like homo
energy. Thought-processing, meditation and control of the body etc.

In this way; on the basis of external structure and shape, the brain has been divided
into two main upper and lower parts. If we look at this structure from left or right, it appears
to be like that of an eye. Therefore, by presenting the shape of external brain similar to that
of left and right eye, relation between brain and eye has been tried to explain through the
following diagrams. The eyes send the information of the outer world to the brain inside.
Therefore, our thinking/analysis and diagnosis (pitta of brain) can be treated through the 10
points present on the eyes. In the following diagrams, the right brain has been located on
the right eye and left brain on the left eye. For their treatment, 10 points of the left and right
mega-meridian is appropriate for the different parts of the brain.
