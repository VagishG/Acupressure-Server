In Ayurvedic Acupressure principle of tulyarthata (comparative study) and its effect
are visualised in each of its component. According to this principle universe (loka)
and living thing (purusha) are similar. Whatever the components are in universe, so
also in living being (organism) also. Based on this principle, what is human body like?
itis like universe. What is our hand/palm like? It is like our body. This is the principle
of tulyarthata, as compared among macro and micro.

In Ayurveda living being is an integration of soul, body (five elements), sense-organs
and mind.

Body is made up of nine elements-Akash (Space), Vayu (Air), Agni (Fire), Jal (Water),
Prithvi (Earth) (five physical elements) and also Kaal (Time), Disha (Direction), Mann
(Mind), Atma (Soul). Tenth element Tama (darkness) is the integral part of all the
elements, described in Ten Origin Principle. All these are elaborately discussed in
“Charak Ayurvedic Acupressure” book published by Sansthan.

According to Ayurvedic concept, Universe and its components are innumerable and
infinite. At macro level we know about the entire universe on the basis of ten elements.

According to Ayurveda, physical and metaphysical are inseparable. For example, in
living being, body is physical and soul (energy or life force) present in it is metaphysical.
Living being (chetan) becomes non-living (achetan) when both get separated. In Akash,
the nature of non-resistance, in Vayu nature of lightness and mobility, in Agni nature of
hotness, in Jal nature of coldness and in Prithvi the nature of stability are inseparable.
