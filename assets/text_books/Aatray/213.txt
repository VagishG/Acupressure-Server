According to the functions, energy number 2, 3, 6, and 7 has been given to the frontal,
parietal, temporal and occipital lobes of cerebrum region of the brain. They take a more
active part in the imaginary functions of the hetero category. Energy numbers 1,4.5and8
have been assigned to the mid brain, pons, medulla and cerebellum of brain stem region of
the brain. The main function of these regions is of the homo or controlling type.

For the diagnosis of the 10 left and right parts of the brain, press the 10 points of the
eyes. For the treatment of related (painful) region or point of eye, use the 10 points of the left
and right mega-meridians.

0 Subdivisions of Brain on Mega-meridian :
In this way, treatment of the 10 parts of the left and right brain is easily done on the left
and right mega-meridians. In case of nodes, swelling, tumour, calcium deposition, injury,

etc. in any region of the brain, treat the mega-meridians according to the energy number of
the related region. A branch treatment can also be given on a single point.

Example — |n case of pain or strain in right occipital region, treat by applying pea/gram
seeds or 5-star magnet on point 7 of RMM.
