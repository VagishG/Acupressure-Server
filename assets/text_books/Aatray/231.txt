20 Subdivisions of Brain on Mega Meridians

From the given diagrams it is clear that treatment of brain can be easily done by the
eye orbits and mega meridians.

Eyes are a main openings of the brain. These two openings are a direct medium for
the transfer of outer world information (colour, shape, size, structure, etc.) to the brain. On
the basis of this information, the brain gets knowledge of various objects which it processes
and tries to recognise. Therefore, in various types of diseases related to brain, treatment
through eyes is very helpful. These eyes show us our faces in the mirror. It is through them
that we are able to see different types of beautiful colours, shapes, sizes, structures, etc.
Healthy eyes are an indicator of healthy mental state and balanced pitta of brain. Therefore,
in diseases such as mental immaturity and lack of understanding,diagnosis and treatment
through the 10 and 20 points of eyes is possible.
