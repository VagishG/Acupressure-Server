Hence, diagnosis of the diseases related to left and right part of the brain is done by
ten points of the nose. Towards left and right side from midline of the nose, ten-ten points
are plotted from top to bottom of the nose. By pressing this, diagnosis of the internal affected
regions of the brain is done. These ten points related to nose are also located in left and
right wrist joint on mega meridian. Therefore, if there is any problem in region of basal nuclei
or fourth ventricle of the brain, treat on related energy number of mega meridian (according
to above diagram).

For Example :
i) Medulla - RMM&LMM -_ 0,1
ii) Cerebellum - RMM&LMM -—) 2,3
ili) 4th Ventricle - RMM&LMM -) 2,3
iv) Cerebral aqueduct - RMM&LMM - 4
v) Hypothalamus - RMM&LMM - 5
vi) Basal Nuclei ~ RMM&LMM -_ 5,6
and/or Thalamus
vii) Lateral Ventricles - RMM&LMM - 6
viii) — Internal Capsule - RMM&LMM - 6
ix)  Fronto- Parietal - RMM&LMM - = 7,8
lobes of cerebrum,
Putamen Area, External Capsule
x) Cerebral fissure - 9
