Nerves of the whole body are presented here in five categories :

i) Ten main nerves of the body

ii) Ten main nerves of the head region

ii) | Tenmain nerves of the arms

iv) | Tenmainnerves of the legs

v) Ten main branches of the sciatic nerve

i) Ten main nerves of the body on Mega Meridians :
Nerves in human body are linked to the brain and spinal cord. Different branches
emerge from these into legs, arms, head and trunk. The longest and most
important nerve in the body is the spinal cord. 12 pairs of cranial nerves in the
head region, energises the regions of left and right brain and different parts of
face. Among these, vagus nerve is the longest and connects to the various

organs of the trunk region providing stimulus. Therefore, the nerves in the head
region are divided into two parts :

i) Vagus Nerve
ii) 11 pairs of cranial nerves

In the arm region, branches of spinal cord arise from the neck and upper-back
area. These branches from a brachial plexus near the left and right shoulders.
Energy in arms is received through three main branches or nerves arising from
it. Three main nerves of arms are:

i) â€” Radial
ii) | Median
ili) Ulnar

In the trunk region, two types of small branches move out from the spinal cord.
These are called thoracic nerves. They spread around the mid-line on the front
of the trunk and on the left and right side of the trunk. The two main network of
nerves of the trunk region are:

i) Anterior cutaneous
i) Lateral cutaneous

In the leg region, two main nerves from the lower lumbar and sacral plexus of
the spinal cord provide energy to the back and front portions of the legs. These
are:

i) Sciatic nerve
il) | Femoralnerve
