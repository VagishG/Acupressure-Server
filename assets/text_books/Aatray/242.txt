According to the above description, main nerves of the whole body have been classified
into ten in the following way :

Head { Vagus Nerve
{ 11 pair cranial nerves
Arm Radial Nerve
Median Nerve
Ulnar Nerve
Trunk Anterior Cutaneous Nerve
{ Lateral Cutaneous Nerve
Leg ( Sciatic Nerve
Femoral Nerve
Longest, Main Nerve Spinal Cord
Energy numbers of these 10 main nerves of the body have been established in the
following way :

Homo Energies: 1, 4,5, 8: In this category, nerves of legs (homo region), nerves
of mid-region of trunk (homo region) and 11 pairs of cranial nerves
of the brain (homo region - due to expansion within the limited
region of the brain), have been shown in the figure below.

Hetero Energies: 2, 3, 6, 7: In this category, nerves on the sides of the trunk (hetero
region) and three main nerves of the arms (hetero region) have
been shown in the figure.

Energy Numbers: 0, 9: The primary nerve of the body spinal cord, from which other
nerves have originated has been given the energy number zero
and the only vagus nerve, which connects the different organs of
the body to the brain, has been given the energy number 9.

It has been presented in the figure and table given below :
