(C-ii) Ten main nerves of the Head region :

12 pairs of cranial nerves have been discovered in the human brain. Among these,
three pairs of nerves control the speed of movement of the eyes. Therefore, on keeping
these three pairs having the same energy region in the same category,a total ten pairs of
cranial nerves have been classified.

The functions, origins, name, etc. of the cranial nerves are being presented in the
form of table below. On the basis of specific attributes of each cranial nerve, they have
been presented with 0-9 energy numbers.
