The nerves provide energy to the arms, arising from the neck and upper-back region.
A group of these nerves is known as left and right brachial plexus. At the lower region of the
neck, the nerves meet to form pairs (left and right) of three main nerves known as lateral,
posterior and medial cord. From these three branches, five main nerves innervate the left
and right arms. It has been clarified through the figures given below.
