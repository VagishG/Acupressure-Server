The decision of energy number of 10 nerves of the arms depends on the location and
origin of the nerve. As we have seen earlier, two nerves from posterior cord — axillary
(smallest) and radial (longest), arise in the form of branches. Therefore, axillary ‘0’ and
radial has been given the number ‘9’. After deciding this, four branches are present in order
onone side of “O nerve — axillary’ of arm— median, musculo-cutaneous, anterior-antibrachial
and posterior-antibrachial cutaneous nerve. Therefore, these have been given the numbers
1,4, 5, 8 related to homo order near 0. On its contrary, again four branches are present on
one side of “9" nerve — radial” — ulnar, deep radial, superficial radial and dorsal-antibrachial
cutaneous nerve. Therefore, these have been given the numbers related to hetero order
near 9 as 2, 3, 6, 7 respectively. This order of energy number have been clarified using the
diagram given below.
