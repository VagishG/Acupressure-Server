Ten nerves of arms have been established in the form of points on the mega meridians.
Treatment is easily done on the basis of these figures and classifications. In diseases such
as muscle wasting in arms, tremors, weakness, numbness, tingling, etc. treatment using
5-star magnets, pea or gram seeds helps regenerate the weak energy level in arms.
(C-iv) Ten main nerves of Legs:

The main nerves which provide energy to legs originate from the lower part of spinal

plexus.

branches are :

i) Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh

ii) Femoral nerve (large nerve of thigh)
iii) | Obturator nerve (inner thigh)
