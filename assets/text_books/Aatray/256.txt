0 Establishment of Energy number of 10 Nerves of Legs :

10 nerve branches of legs have been shown in the above figure. The main nerve of the
front part of the leg, femoral, has been given the number ‘0’ and the main nerve of the back
part of the leg, sciatic, has been given the number ‘9’. This has been established according
to the location. Femoral nerve while moving from ‘0’ towards the outer part of the legs
divides into four main branches as shown in the figure. These have been classified and
related with energy number 2, 3, 6, 7 of hetero category. These are :

'2'- _ Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh

‘3'- | Deep peroneal nerve

‘6'-  Superticial peroneal nerve

‘7'-  Sural nerve

Again, femoral nerve moving from ‘0’ towards the inner part of the legs divides into four
branches as shown in the figure. Their energy number has been established as 1, 4, 5, 8 in
order of homo category. These are :

‘{'-  Obturator nerve

'4'- Saphenous nerve

'5'- Posterior cutaneous of thigh

'8'- Tibial nerve

In this way, ten nerves of legs and their related energies have been established. On its
basis, if the energy of legs gets diseased, then for treatment, nerves of left and right legs
have been established on the left and right mega meridians. Its plotting has been presented
below:
