(C-v) Ten main branches of Sciatic Nerve :

Sciatic nerve is the main nerve of legs. It originates from the lower part of spinal cord
or sacral plexus. The nerves from lumbar and sacral regions of waist join together to form
sacral plexus. Two main nerves emerge / out of the sacral pléxus in the left and right part.
These are known as common peroneal nerve and tibial nerve. These nerves in the left part
join together to form the sciatica nerve of the left leg, and in the right part to form the sciatica
nerve of the right leg. This has been shown through the following figure :
