This sciatica nerve moves downwards, towards the back of both legs. Behind the
knees, it again divides into CPN and TN branches. The five branches of CPN provide
energy to the frontal and outer parts of leg and the four branches of TN provide energy to
the rear parts of legs. One branch each from CPN and TN join together to form sural nerve
in the outer-edge region of legs.!n this way, a total of 10 (5+4+1) branches originate trom
the sciatic nerve, and reach the various regions of the legs.

Different branches of sciatica nerve have been shown in the diagram :
