Establishment of Energy Number of the 10 Branches of Sciatica Nerve — As it is clear
from the figure above, sciatica nerve has two main branches. The sciatica nerve originates
from these two therefore, CPN (outwards) and TN (inwards), near the origin (0), have been
given the energy number 2 and 1 respectively. These two nerves again become one in the
form of sural nerve. Therefore, sural nerve has been given the number ‘0’. Other
energy numbers are in the form of CPN and TN branches. Four branches of CPN move
into the outer, hetero region of legs, therefore these have been related with energy numbers
3,6, 7,9.
