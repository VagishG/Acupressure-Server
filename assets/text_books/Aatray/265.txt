(ii) 10 arteries of the lower part of the body :

Circulation of pure blood in lower part of the body is also done by the heart, aorta and
its branches. Arteries of lower part of the body have been clarified through the figure. Among
these, two specific arteries have been connected by the numbers ‘0’ and ‘9’. Important
organs below the diaphragm are — liver, gall bladder, pancreas, stomach, spleen. All these

get nutrition through a single artery known as coeliac artery.

Therefore, it has been related

with energy number ‘0’. The main and longest artery, abdominal aorta, has again been
connected with number ‘0’. As branches of aorta emerge from below the diaphragm region,
their energy numbers from 1 to 8 have been allotted accordingly. Among them, some arteries
provide pure blood to diaphragm, kidney and intestines. Other arteries provide energy and
Nutrition through blood in reproductive organs, pelvic region and legs. Figures and energy
numbers of the arteries of lower part of the body are being presented below :
