All arteries of the human body have been divided into two parts (above and below the
diaphragm) on the mega meridians. The upper region is Yang or hetero dominant while the
lower region is Yin or homo dominant. Therefore, the upper arteries on LMM and lower
arteries have been plotted on the RMM. It is shown in the figure.
