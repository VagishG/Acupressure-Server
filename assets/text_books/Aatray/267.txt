On the basis of the above figures, treatment of the 10 main arteries of the body is done
using each point of the mega meridians. In case of obstruction or stagnation in an artery,
treat by applying pea or gram seed on the related point. For branch treatment of arteries
and veins, direction of energy flow of points will be normai and opposite, respectively. In
case of branch treatment in artery, use the previously described methods.

(iii) 10 veins of the upper part of the body :

Veins of human body carry deoxygenated blood from the cells of the body into the
heart. Venous blood of whole body is collected in the right part of the heart. Impure blood
from the upper and lower part of the body is brought into the heart through the superior and
inferior vena cava. As the only artery, the pulmonary artery carries impure blood from Heart
to Lungs (for purification), it has been alloted the energy "0". Impure blood from the upper
parts of the body is carried through a main vein — superior vena cava. Therefore, it has
been allotted the energy number ‘9’. Energy numbers of other veins according to the upper
left and right region are in the order homo (1, 4, 5, 8) and hetero (2, 3, 6, 7). It has been
cleared through the figure.
