Veins of upper and lower parts of the body have been plotted on left and right mega
meridians respectively. They are being presented in the figures below. Keep the direction in
mind in case of branch treatment. Veins carry blood towards the heart. Therefore, their
point ‘0’ has been taken on the wrist towards the fingers and point ‘9’ on the other side (as
opposite flow). Ten energies of branch points are presented through the diagram.
