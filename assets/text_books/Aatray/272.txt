Hence, specifically like on each finger different acupoints and meridians are present,
so the entire energy of these fingers, in a dense form, is present in these mega-meridians.
The effect observed by joining the acupoints of all five fingers of a hand can be achieved by
amega-meridian. Unlimited energy and power is present in these ten points of each mega-
meridian. Instead of naming these as acupoints, it has been specified that each MM point is
as effective as 150 acupoints. It can be imagined as a small atom bomb. Therefore, we can
only feel the importance of wrist joints, when we massage our wrists every day and observe
its effect. Due to each point on the mega meridian being a centre of dense energy, each
point within itself is comparable to a yogic chakra, which we can classify in various categories
of chakras.

Again, from scientific point of view, the brain situated in the head is a region of dense
energy and arms and legs are its extensions. Therefore, arm is commonly a region of
dense energy and specifically head is hetero in relation to trunk, which is towards akash.
Similarly, in hands, specifically the joints of wrists are at a special place from the energy
point of view.
