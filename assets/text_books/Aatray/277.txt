have been allotted the energy ‘5’ and ‘6’ respectively. In an outwardly-increasing order,
the number of humerus bone of upper arm is ‘7’ and the number of radio-ulna bones of
forearms is ‘8’. The small bones of palms and fingers have been allotted the energy
number ‘9’. In this way, by classifying all bones of the upper part of the body into ten
and transforming them into energies, treatment on the left mega meridian (hetero-
upper part) is carried out.
