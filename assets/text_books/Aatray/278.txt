(iii) Ten Main Bones of the Lower Part of the Body :

The classification of bones below the diaphragm region into ten again takes us towards
micro-treatment. The below region is homo therefore treatment will be done on the
RMM. The classification of bones and allotment of energy numbers has been done on
the basis of their position. In a top-down order, as in the upper region skull was allotted
the number ‘0’, similarly pelvis bone of the lower region is related to ‘0’. The lumbar
and sacral bones connected to it in the back region have been allotted the number ‘1’
and ‘2' respectively. Moving downwards, bones of the left and right legs have been
related to number ‘3’ and ‘4’. Homo energies 4, 5, 8 in right and hetero energies 3, 6, 7
have been allotted in the left leg. Therefore, bones, below the knees have been given
the number 5, 6 and, of the feet have been given the number 7, 8. The smallest bone
of the lower part, coccyx, has been allotted the number ‘9’.
