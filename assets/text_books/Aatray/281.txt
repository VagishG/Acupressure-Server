Homo Energy Dominant and Left is Hetero Energy Dominant. Right Mega Meridian (RMM)
works like Mother while Left Mega Meridian (LMM) works like the Father. In right hand
energy number starts with 0 because Right is Homo. Therefore the Energy Number is
started from the right wrist (Energy Number=0).

Taking forward this Energy Numbering from 0 to 9, every joint has been given one
Energy Number. These first ten joints(from 0 to 9), are Hetero Dominant. The next ten joints
are Neutro while the last ten joints are Homo Dominant. In the Right Hand the Energy Number,
as right is Homo, starts from 0, the upper and lower joint of thumb is number 1 and 2
respectively, while in other joints the Energy Number is assigned from top to bottom, in Homo
order. Contrary to this the Left Hand is Hetero Dominant. Therefore in left hand the Numbering
order is from bottom to top (in Hetero order). This is explained in the below diagram â€” (This is
used not only for Bones but also for the 30 subdivisions of any Body Fluid).

Bones of Human Body = 30 Segments
1st Segment - Head and Neck bones (10)
2nd Segment - Chest and Arm bones (10)
3rd Segment - Abdomen and Leg bones (10)
