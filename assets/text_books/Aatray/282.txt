a) TenMain Bones of Head and Neck Region :

These have been explained through the figure. There are several bones in the head
region. In the neck region, there are seven cervical bones and a hyoid bone. Therefore, due
to their having a specific position away from the head, these were allotted the number ‘0’.
Starting from the upper-front region in the skull, energy numbers have been allotted from
1to9.

1- Frontal bone (in the front)

2- Sphenoid bone (in the middle of the skull, behind the eyes)

3 Ethmoid bone (beside sphenoid and a little downwards)

4 Parietal bone (two bones in the upper, outer part of the skull)

5- Temporal bone (two bones on the edges of the skull)

6- Zygomatic bone (left and right cheek bone)

7- Maxilla and Mandible (bones of the jaws)

8- Occipital bone (in the lower-back of the skull)

9- Group of small bones near the nose

For their treatment, choose the first 0-9 order of the 30 subdivisions. It has
