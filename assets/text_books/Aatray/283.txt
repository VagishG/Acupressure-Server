(3) Structure and Acu-Points of Mega Meridians

All the dual structures of the human body are treated and their energy is balanced by
these mega- meridians easily. In our body, the basis for divisions into two are mainly the
principles of Yin-Yang and Homo-Hetero. According to this, human body is divided into
three parts:

2) Below the Diaphragm region in 2) Above the Diaphragm region

3) Right part pay ARE 5) Left Part LMM

Keeping in mind the above principles, any of two equal structures can be categorised
into homo and hetero. On the basis of this, in right mega meridian dominance of homo
eneigy and in left mega meridian dominance of hetero energy are selected. Commnly a
person mostly uses right hand and left hand sometimes to assist. According to functioning
of hands, right hand (right mega meridian- RMM) is said as yin or dominating homo energy
and left hand (left mega meridian- LMM) yang or dominating hetero energy. Therefore all the
homo or yin energy parts of the body are treated by RMM and hetero or yang energy parts
by LMM easily. It is clarified by the table given below:
