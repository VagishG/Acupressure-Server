b) Ten Main Bones of Chest and Arms:

The bones of the mid-region of the body are classified into 10 parts. The classification
is based on the position of the bones as well as top to bottom and central to periphery order.
Hence the central to periphery order of the chest has been taken. The sternum bone in the
centre of the chest, numbered 0, has been shown. The two adjoining thin collar bones,
Claivicle has been numbered 1. Below and behind them, triangular Scapula Bone has been
numbered 2. The middle ribs have number 3 and in outer-side the bones of upper
arms(Humerus) is number 4. Two bones of forearm Ulna and Radius have the number 5
and 6 respectively while the small bones of Carpal is number 7; Phalanges and Metacarpals
of palm and fingers are number 8. Bones of upper back, Thoracic Vertebrae is related with
number 9.

This way the ten subdivisions of the main bones in chest and hand region are shown.
For treatment of these, choose the middle 10 subdivisions from the 30 subdivisions of the
Hand. It is again clarified in the following pages.
