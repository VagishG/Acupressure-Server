The number of coccyx bones has been found to be different in different people. Here,
they are being treated as a single coccyx bone. Hence, the total number of bones in the
vertebral column comes up to be 30 (7+12+5+5+1). These have been orderly related to the
30 sub-divisions of mega meridians, and separate treatment for each bone of the spine has
been presented in a similar manner. Starting from the coccyx bone at the bottom, numbers
of ten bones from ‘0’ to ‘9’ have been determined in order. This has been explained by the
figure below :

30 bones of spine, on the joints of hands

Cervical -1

From the figure above, treat each bone of the Spine by applying Methi-Strips on the
joints of fingers in the hand. !n case of joining of the related bones or accumulation of
Osteophytes etc. treat using the 10 energy points on the related joint. Generally treatment
on the joints by Methi-Strips gives immense relief. In case of Sciatica pain give treatment
on L3-L4 joints and in case of stiffness in neck massage on the cervical joints and twist
the painful ones. In this way, acute as well as chronic diseases of the bones of spine are
treated through these 30 sub-divisions of the Mega Meridians.

b) Plotting of 3-3 vertebrae on Right Mega Meridian :

Earlier, we learned about the different Energy forms of RMM and LMM. Among
them, one of the states is the Nervous System of the Body. It is divided into two
