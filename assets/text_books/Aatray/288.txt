main parts- Brain and Spinal Cord. On this basis, according to their working ability,
Brain lies under Hetero Dominant while Spinal Cord lies under the Homo Dominant
category. Therefore treatment of Brain is done through LMM while that of Spine is
done through RMM.

Treatment of the spine on the right Mega Meridian and flow of energy in their
related region is being presented below. Within the vertebrae of the Human spine,
lies the Spinal Cord, a rope like part of the brain. From its right and left, different
nerve fibres provide energy in the internal and external parts of the body. The
brain generates nerve impulses and the spinal cord distributes it in the body. The
nerve impulses emerging from the neck provide energy in the regions of arms,
shoulders, chest and face. Similarly, left and right nerve fibres, emerging from the
mid-waist, provide energy to the liver, gall bladder and spleen organs. From lower
back the Energy flows to kidneys, urinary bladder and gonads while the upper
back helps in keeping the heart and lungs active. .

In this way, a network of nerve fibres from left and right of spinal cord spreads all
over the bogy. It is the prime source of Energy and Vitality. It keeps all the organs
active. This working of the spinal cord is explained by the below diagrams.

Brain & Spinal Cord Relation between the body organs & Spine

Nerve-fibres of spinal-cord in neck, Energy flow from numerous branches of
back, arm and leg of the body spine to the different organs of the body
