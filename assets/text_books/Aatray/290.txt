Each group of 3 vertebrae has been assigned an Energy Number. In this way, these
are plotted on the RMM. Each point on RMM, is best suited for the treatment of the spinal
nerves, organs as well as other body parts, which are related with the corresponding
vertebrae. This is been explained by the figure below.

Spine on RMM

Based on the above figure, through any point we can easily treat the related regions of
the body. For example, in case of Abdomen diseases give treatment on RMM - 0, 1, 2
points using Pea seeds; for Fatty Liver apply 5-5 Star magnets on RMM - 4, 5.
