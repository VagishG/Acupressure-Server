CLASSIFICATION OF PLASMA - BLOOD - HORMONES
1) Constituents of Plasma:

i) | Water > 90%, asmain component of plasma.
il) Proteins g 7%, mainly albumin, globulin, antibodies, fibrinogen, clotting
factors.

— their basic role : maintain viscosity / thickness,
carry mineral salts & hormones, inhibit enzymes.

iii) MineralSalts > mainly sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium bicarbonate
(NaHCO,), potassium, magnesium, phosphates, iron,
calcium, copper, iodine, cobalt.

— their basic role : cell formation, muscle contractions,
impulse transmissions, form secretions, maintain acid-
base balance.

iv) Nutrients = mainly glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol,
vitamins.

- their basic role : provide energy & heat, repair,
replacement, synthesis of blood componentssantu

secretions.
v) Wastes =) mainly urea, uric acid, creatinine, carbon dioxide.
vi) Hormones > carried by plasma proteins.

—role : for specialized activities.
vii) Enzymes > catalysers/promotors / conductors of all types of reactions.
viii) Gases = mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen.
About Plasma => Blood minus blood cells.
=> hence the fluid part of blood

=> canbe called as primitive stage to blood formation through
GIT nutrients.

=> First tissue of human body.
0 Tendivisions of Plasma:

From the above data, there are 8 basic constituents of plasma. Among them we can
seperate 2 specific components :

i) From proteins — clotting factors and
ii) From nutrients > vitamins
as they hold specific position among the rest. They have more vital role to perform.

Hence ten divisions of plasma tissue are available. Their energy allotment is discussed
here atter.
