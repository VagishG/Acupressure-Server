10 divisions of Plasma (in energy sequence) :

Components of Plasma Analysis of Energy

Wastes excreted by body holes
Vitamins Small component for biological activity
Gases Light in weight, are carried through
Nutrients heat and energy supply
Water as cohesive fluid
Proteins provide density, carry substances
Enzymes promotors or conductors
Mineral salts multi purpose roles of maintainance
Clotting factors play role.in sequencial manner
Hormones regulation of activities.
2) Constituents of Blood :
About Blood— —_acconnective tissue
— means of communication
between

cellto cell body & environment
-  7%of body weight (approx 5 Lt.)
-  alwaysin motion
— maintains a constant environment
- slightly alkaline (pH 7.35 - 7.45)

Components:

i) Oxygen - _ transported from lungs to tissues.

ii) Carbondioxide - transported from tissues to Lungs.

ili) Nutrients - transported from GIT to tissues.

iv) Wastes — __ transported from cells to excretory organs.

v) Hormones — carried through to target glands / tissues.

vi) Heat - maintainance of homeostatis by transfer from active to
less active tissues.
