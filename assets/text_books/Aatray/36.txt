Use of left and right mega meridians can be done for any disease of the body. By
using Mega Meridian, the number of treatment points remains less and patient himself is
able to perform the treatment. It is like as if instead of using many small acu-points (small
dose), using one big and very effective (heavy dose) point in order to encourage the patients
to treat themselves. When the person (patient) himself, daily, treats his disease, then they
have the urge to feel its effect right away. After all, every day he is doing so much effort for
it. Only by keeping ourselves healthy, we can feel that unlimited energy/life force within us.
This is known as realization of the self or "Atma Darshan".

Can these two wrists of the human body free us from the body, mind and soul related
diseases? Can the effect of works done in our previous lives by us, which has moved on in
the form of a disease, be cleared? Why the creator of the universe sent us on this earth, for
what objective he created us; can we know it and move towards fulfilling it - the answers to
all these questions, can be patiently understood by treating on Mega Meridians. Let us see
how far and deep the effect of each of their point goes.
