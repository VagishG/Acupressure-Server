Now our Sansthan is nourishing and sustaining this Treatment Method on the principles
of Ayurveda. Comparing the body with the Universe,reveals the truth that the creation,
function as well as the destruction of Nature is impossible without it. Therefore as the great
sources of energy are visible in the Universe, are similar energy sources visible in the
human body? To answer this question let us take Mountains and Rivers as the two objects
in the Universe. Mountains have mineral ores, forests, timbre, medicines as the different
sources of energy whereas Rivers have water as the energy source. Likewise in human
body the Brain, situated in the Head, is the region of dense energy and the two arms and
the limbs are the big conductors of that energy. Scientists refer to them as Extensions of
Brain or Extremities while the philosophers and the sages refer to them as Action Organs.
The dense Energy region in human body is in the Head, which is towards Heaven. Similarly
in case of arms and legs the distal joints i.e. the wrists and the ankles are depicted as the
dense source of Energy. The energy sources contained in them are commonly termed as
Mega Meridians while the energy sources in Legs are specifically termed as Mega Meridians
of Legs. In this way the treatment of the whole body, against any disease, is possible by the
two Mega Meridians. However according to the principle of Duality, which serve as an
extension of MM concept, special treatment is given by using the Mega Meridians of Legs.|n
this book each joint wrist and ankle are divided into 10 parts (according to Ten Origin
Principle) as 10 points with the help of diagrams. Treatment can be given ona single point
or on multiple points, depending upon the severity of the disease. Many tables of Diagnosis
are included in the book ‘Charak Ayurvedic Acupuncture’ published by Sansthan. Their
repetition is just to enhance the importance of the book. The readers might find it unpleasant,
which we regret humbly.
