with a different perspective, their relation feels like that of living and non-living. Elements
and their inherent energies: “non-living and their minimum vitality’. We can understand this
with the example of element water and the presence of coldness inside it. Similarly, in each
organ one is structure of the tissue and other is their function, this shows duality.
Therefore, in mega meridian, treatment of every 0’ _.an is possible :
RMM LVM

Organ: Structure Function
In another form of this principle, person and their inherent energy are balanced by the
mega meridian :
RMM LMM

Human being: Physicalbody Soul

In acupressure, different organs are studied in the form of pair of yin-yang. Therefore,
fe this way, by plotting each paired-organ on the mega meridian, treatment can be given:

ra LMM

j € Gall Bladder
ai Small Intestine

= (Yin organs) Stomach (Yang organs)

YG Large Intestine

Urinary Bladder

Before any further discussion on the vast dimensions of Mega Meridians, let us try to
understand the above examples from the point of view of treatment.
(1) Right Leg affected by polio:
In this situation, check the ten points on RMM related to right leg. On painful
points, treat by applying five star magnets or cluster magnet or gram/ pea seed.
Select the disease related points on RMM from among the ten points for most

effective treatment. Polio happens due to infection. In it, nerve and blood circulation
becomes weak in related region. So,the common treatment will be:

RMM- oT9l 3,4,67 2,5,71 0123456789
(For Infection) (Blood) (Nerve)
