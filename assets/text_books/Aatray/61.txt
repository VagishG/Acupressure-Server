According to Dr., Right Leg muscles have been ruptured hence severe bed rest
with medication. There was no relief after one year of treatment. A second opinion
resulted in Thyroid test as there was swelling in the body and pus formation was

suspected.

The Thyroid was normal but weight kept increasing.

treatment.
