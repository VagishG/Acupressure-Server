Consulted several doctors for persistent leg pain. Arthritis and Sciatica was
suspected. The patient was put on traction which only aggravated the problem.
The blood test showed increased uric acid hence there was no relief.

Got 75% relief in all troubles after treatment by Acupressure on 19.11.06.
