area of pons, on both sides of which

are the cerebellar lobes. This part helps

in body balance and acts as a bridge Septum Corpus

for efferent/afferent nerve fibers. Lucidum Callosum

If there is infection in this region of |

brain, lack of blood supply or swelling
then the impulses coming and going
from this region get obstructed. When
the medulla is affected then its related
control center of body is also influ-
enced. In the medulla are cardiac cen-
ter, respiratory center, swallowing cen-
ter, vomiting center, coughing center etc.
Hence if medulla is affected then some-
times the symptoms like cough, vomit-
ing, palpitation etc are left untreated by
common points. In such a condition
along with other treatments medulla
should also be treated.

It is clear form the above figure that on finger no. 6 and 7 are plotted the spine, medulla, pons
and cerebellum. Treatment of these joints can control the disease symptoms manifested in any
parts of body. The finger of time (finger No 6) is related to medulla and spine, while the finger
of direction (finger No 7) is related to pons and cerebellum are highly effective in treatment to
regulate the impulses during imbalance in walking or other related disorders of face, head,
neck, trunk, etc. On the basis of the following list the treatment on left ring finger base joint can
be given by a methi strip or by energy inference on this joint for specific treatment.
