C) Kapha- (Jal + Prithvi) - YY

The element Jal is known for its fluidity while the element prithvi is known for its hardness. You
must have seen that how a potter makes the pots by mixing water in the mud to make it soft or
usable. A potter can only make pots when the mud i.e. prithvi element and Jal are mixed in
such a manner that the pots can be given their shape. If in the mud if the water is excess or
deficient, the pot cannot be made. In our human body the Jal element and the prithvi element
establish harmony due to which the body is active and lively. An imbalance among them
causes some discomfort and one gets sick. In human body the diseases due to an imbalance
between Jal and prithvi elements can be relieved by increasing one element and decreasing the
other to maintain harmony and balance.
