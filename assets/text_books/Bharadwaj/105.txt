heart has four chambers).

In the left chamber of the heart is
the pure blood which is circulated
in the whole body through arteries
by the contraction of the left lower
chamber called left ventricle. In the
right chamber is the impure blood,
which comes from veins all over
the body. This blood, by contrac-
tion of the right ventricle is sent to
lungs by the pulmonary arteries,
whereby the process of respiration,
oxygen is mixed in the blood and
carbon dioxide is removed. Thus
when the blood is purified, it is sent
back to heart in left upper cham-
ber by the pulmonary veins. From
here, by the left ventricle it is cir-
culated in the entire body. In this.
manner the process of circulation
goes on. At a normal pace, the
heart pumps the blood at the beat-
ing rate of 70-75 beats per minute.

Circulatory System

In this system the nose, air tube and both the lungs
are included. Along with them, the diaphragm, chest
and abdominal muscles also help in respiration.

The going in of air in lungs and coming out is called
the respiratory process. The intake of air is called in-
spiration while the outward dispelling of air is called
expiration. When fresh air gets filled in the lungs, then
it comes in contact with fine blood capillaries and dur-
ing this process the carbon dioxide, humidity and
vapourising materials are removed and oxygen is filled
up.

In an ordinary course, a healthy person inhales and
exhales for 13 to 18 times in a minute. While in small
