various activities of human body. If we observe the palms we find that it also has
four fingers in the form of four extensions. The role of fingers in the palms is the same
as regulation of all activities as that of arms and legs in the body and hence they hold
the same place. On this basis also the palm and human body can be easily estab-
lished as similar to each other on the basis of similarity principle.

5. Comparison on the basis of 5 structures-

(5)

In our human body there are 5 structures projected outwards which provide com-
plete unit to the human body. The 5 structures projecting from the trunk are — head

Five projections from the trunk Five projections from the palm

on the top, two arms and two legs downwards. These five structures have a unique
co-ordination from the view point of activity. The brain residing in the head is the
director on whose orders the arms and legs work. Actually the arms and legs are the
extensions of the brain. On observing the palms a similar condition is visible. The
middle flat part of the palm resembles the trunk and the four fingers resemble the 5
structures projecting outwards. Further on observing their functions we come to know
that they also have a unique co-ordination. Without thumb the fingers are unable to
do their work. Hence it is clear that the palm resembles the human body.

6. Six structures in the palms as in the body-

In our body the main six structures can be clearly visible- two arms, two legs, one
head and one trunk. A human body is made up of these six structures. Palm also has
similar six structures — four fingers, one thumb and mid part of palm. In this manner
