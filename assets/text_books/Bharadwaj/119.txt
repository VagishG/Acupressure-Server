Regulated Routine

A regulated routine is the basis of good health. Who does not know the importance of time
(kaal) during the human life time? The person's who respect the time, usually are placed on the
top most position i.e. become most successful in life. On the other hand one who disobeys or
disrespects time, then time punishes him/her. Hence we should realise the importance of time
and we should regulate our daily routine with proper time segments. In one day there are 24
hours in which we have to perform our daily activities, work and sleep according to the nature.
For this we have to clearly define when to sleep, when to get up in the morning, when to eat
food and when to perform other daily routines. According to the nature we have to know how
to regulate a routine, by the pattern of energy cycle. This has been named as Ayurvedic Bio-
logical Clock.

The three biological forces Vata, Pitta and Kapha have been used to divide the 24 hours as
shown in the Ayurvedic biological clock below.

Vata, Pitta and Kapha are important forces working in the human body. In the above clock we
can practically see the time duration in which these three forces are working.

Vata includes Akash and Vayu Mahabhoot (space and air) and is the regulator of all our
desires and activities. Due to this Vata, are senses are able to perform their work. Vata is the
