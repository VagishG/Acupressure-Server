Special feature of its structure is that its wall is made up of involuntary muscles and it has
peristaltic movement. The main function of small intestine is to absorb the nutritive elements

ments from it. There is secretion of digestive juices in the small intestine and they mix with the
food and help in its digestion. Most of the food is digested in the small intestine, and the
products formed like acids, sugars and fatty acids are absorbed by the small intestine. The
spleen forms the blood by the help of this absorbed material.
