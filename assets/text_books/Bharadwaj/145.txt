Ayurvedic concept envisages life is an integration of physical body (composed of five physical
elements eg.. Akash, Vayu, Agni, Jal & Prithvi), sense organs and karmendriyas, mind (analyser
of all informations received through sense organs and executor of.all activities through five
karmendriyas eg. speech, arms, legs, urine & gonadal hole and anal hole) and Atma - life
force which is at back of all the activities. All organs, therefore, are agents of all activities
desiring impetus from bioenergy i.e. Atma. Therefore harmonisation of all is indicator of good
health and as such life becomes smooth life process without any hinderance. Lack of
harmonisation allows infilteration of toxins in the body through the cosmic factors Air, pres-
sure, temperature etc. and from food which is taken daily and from routine disturbance non
observation of timing for intake of food and going to bed for sleep. All these lead from bad to
worse, from worse to worst (almost depleted or degenerated) condition of physical body ie. ill
health.
