7. Diagnosis and treatment by vertical meridians-

According to ayurvedic acupressure there are multiple energy channels and meridians in our
body through which the energy flows to every cell of the body. These meridians have been
figured out in the body as vertical, horizontal and spiral. By the 10 origin principle of ayurvedic
acupressure, the whole body is divided into 10 main regions by the view point of vertical
meridians as shown below.

On the basis of the location of these meridians the place of disease symptoms helps to select
the affected meridian passing through that region. For the treatment the 10 meridians on both
the thumbs are used and the related meridian is selected. In the thumbs the location of merid-
ians are as follows.
