For this we have to check the finger of the right and left hands and test them by twisting.

If the finger or toe number 0 is painful on twisting then it indicates that the disease is due to tam
element and this element is to be treated. Similarly the fingers which are painful on twisting
then that finger related element is to be treated. If more than one finger is painful then the most
painful finger is selected and the related element, organs, and body part is treated.

Question arises as what is the basis to select the fingers and toes i.e. when to choose the finger
and when to choose the toes?

Practically the fingers and toes are selected based on the location of the disease. If the disease
is related to the part of body above diaphragm then the fingers are selected and when the
disease is below diaphragm then toes are selected for treatment.
