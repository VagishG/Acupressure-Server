blood gets infected and this leads to breathing disorders and skin diseases. The infections enter
in the body from food pipe and wind pipe, spreads in every cell of body and the body’s immu-
nity is affected. According to ayurved, the minute sized these microbes similar to the subtler
soul are highly injurious and hence are alike by subtleness.

For the treatment of infection according to 10 origin principle of ayurvedic acupressure we
increase the energy of zero point (Tam) by which the healthy cell of the body becomes sensitive
to face the infection. Along with this the point no- 9 (Atma — Soul) energy is reduced so that
these soul like small living body growths can be reduced. In this manner by increasing the zero
energy and decreasing the 9" energy, a control on infection related common to chronic disor-
ders can be achieved. By these points, long term treatment can be done to increase the immu-
nity of the body. The patients of frequent cough and cold and fever thus get substantial relief.
For the treatment of infection, in the related organ meridians, 0 energy is increased and 9*
energy is decreased to control the infection. This can be understood by an example.

When the GIT is infected the related main organs like stomach, small intestine and large intes-
tine are treated on these meridians as shown below.
