magnet, chakra magnet, strip of methi etc as shown
below.

Itcan be easily understood by an example. If there
is pain on left index finger then the affected or-
gan on this finger i.e. liver, gall bladder, pancreas
can be selected (on the basis of pain) on pressing
the phalanges and the affected phalanx is treated
by five star magnet as shown here.

Similarly if any patient is suffering from loose mo-
tion then both the small fingers are selected by
testing the pain and the phalanx of small intes-
tine and large intestine is selected by the intensity
of pain on the related phalanx. The painful pha-
lanx can be easily treated by 5 star magnet, chakra
magnet or methi strip.
