Above description of the finger joints can also be used for specific diagnosis and treatment, for
example if there is pain in the upper joint of left small finger then it indicates some problem of
small intestine. In this manner by pressing or twisting on joints, we can diagnose the affected
organ and endocrine gland and treat on the joints. From the view point of treatment, methi
strip on the finger joints is used.

For the specific treatment of the organ and endocrine gland, 10 points related to 10 elements
are plotted on each joint as shown below-

By the above description when the organ is diagnosed and the joint selected then the energy
inference on these 10 points is taken out. The treatment done on the basis of this energy
inference is highly specific and effective.

Energy Inference- In this acupressure therapy the imbalance of energy is considered as a
disease. In a human when the different type of energies are in a balanced state then only one
is said to be healthy. Imbalance of energy makes a person diseased. Imbalance means the
energy is either excess or deficient. If we come to know in our body or any organ, which
energy is imbalanced, excess or deficient due to which the disease has appeared, then we can
easily balance the energy and treat the illness.

In ayurvedic acupressure the assessment of energy in body, in any of its part or specific organ
on the 10 element points is known as energy inference. We take the help of byol magnet or
finger magnet and testing the 10 element points, depict it as ‘-' or ‘+’ signs.

Every byo! magnet has two poles- North pole and south pole. The north pole is used to increase
