The method to prepare the energy inference-

By an example the method of energy inference can be discussed. We have seen above that the
right hand small finger upper joint is related to large intestine. The 10 element points of this
joint and the related energies are shown below.

Now if we have to measure 10 energies related to the large intestine then on the first zero
number point, increase the energy by white byol magnet. If in this condition the patient feels
heaviness and uneasiness in his head or the symptoms appear to be aggravated, then it indi-
cates that this point already has excess energy and on increasing by white byol magnet, the
patient feels discomfort. This condition is shown by putting ‘+’ sign below the number.
Similarly if on increasing the energy on the 0 point the patient has no feeling, then energy is
reduced by yellow magnet. If in this condition patient feels discomfort then it indicates that
energy was already deficient at this point and on decreasing by yellow magnet the patient felt
discomfort. This condition is shown by putting a - sign below the zero.

Repeating this process from 0-9 point, the energy inference of large intestine point is prepared
as follows

0123456789

This patient is suffering from loose motion, 8-10 times in a day. Loose motion indicates excess
water element which is clear from the above energy inference where element no. four (water
element) and below it a + sign indicates an excessiveness. Similarly more frequency of loose
motion indicates excess vayu (air) element which is clear from above as 2 no. (vayu) has +
sign i.e. excess energy.
