middle part neutro and the lower part is called homo. Any of these three parts affected, is
related to the finger zero i.e. right thumb and effective treatment can be given by putting five
star magnets on phalanx or methi strip on joints. Similarly disease symptoms appearing in
the area of left ear or temporal lobe of brain, then the finger No. 6 is selected and the related
Homo, Hetero and Neutro regions are selected according to the position of disease and
simple treatment of five star magnet on the affected phalanx is given. On the back of head
the regions of origin numbers 7, 8 and 9 are manifested, hence for this area treatment of
