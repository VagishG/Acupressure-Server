plete unit. On this basis at the first sight their similarity is established. Further expand-
ing the thought process, as the human body is one unit similarly the palms are such a
unit in which the whole body can be similarly established (as shown in Fig. 1)

2. Similar view of body and palms in 2 parts —
On the analysis of human body its two parts are clearly visible :
1. Front part
2. Back part

The front portion of the body is comparatively brighter while back part is darker in
colour. On studying the palms we come to know that it also has the front part brighter

(2) Front of palm Back part of palm

Fist-palm closed on front

and back part comparatively darker in colour. Similarly the body can be easily bent
forward while it is difficult to bend it backwards. Now if we pay attention to the palms
they can be folded in the front as a fist but difficult to bend backwards. Thus the front
and back parts of the human body are in complete similarity with the palms on the
basis of its structure.

3. Comparison on the basis of joints of the body —

In our human body there are multiple joints which help in smooth functioning. On the
analysis of these joints we find that on the basis of their number there is a unique
similarity in the body and the palms.

For example - In our arms there are 3 joints - shoulder joint, the elbow joint and wrist
joint. Similarly there are 3 main joints in the legs - hip joint, knee joint and the ankle
