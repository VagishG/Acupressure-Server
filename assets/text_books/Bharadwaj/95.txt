(destruction) the entire cosmos is engrossed in tam (darkness). As all the entities and objects
start appearing on a slight ray of light in this darkness, they come into existence, similarly all
types of entities originate from this tam. Tam (darkness) is the basis and the origin point of the
entire nature and the complete creation. From this very point all entities are born and in due
course of time they return back to it. Tam is the beginning and origin point of this life cycle.
This human body is also an extension of the tam, which in due course of time ends in this tam.
