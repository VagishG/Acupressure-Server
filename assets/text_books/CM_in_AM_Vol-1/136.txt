In Ayurvedic Acupressure this 10 origin table is worth consideration and is the
sole basis in treatment of any type of acute and chronic diseases.

Note —Ayurvedic Acupressure is latest integration of TCM/ Sujok, physiology and
anatomy and above all, vision of Ayurveda which is known as fifth veda, deals in life
process whether amoeba, insects, crawlers, creepers, birds, plant life ,animal life,
lastly human body. It is divine oration from shrimukha of creator of universe (Lord
Brahma) to his sons, for wellness of human beings for all ages to come i.e. from Satyug,
Treta, Dwapar and present Kaliyug. As such itis ageless and for all ages to come and
for treatment of diseases of all ages which we can say as in nomenclature of AIDS,
dengue , swine flue, cortical atrophy, muscular dystrophy or atrophy, delayed milestones
etc. But all these could be considered in Ayurvedic Acupressure which is based on
infinity. Itis oldest science/scripture and most potent and divine in nature and applicable
and valid in the modern diseases and symptoms, and nature can be understood in
view of 10 origin theory narrated in the Ayurvedic Acupressure fundamental books —
