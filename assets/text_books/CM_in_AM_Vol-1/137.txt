As we know there are 14 joints manifested in each palm and sole. Also 14
meridians have been identified by Chinese scholars on each side i.e. Left and
right at least 3000 years ago, when physiology, anatomy could not come in
existence.

All 14 Chinese meridians have been plotted / assigned on each joint of left and
tight palms and soles. Thus it satisfies the principle of tulyarthata of Ayurveda.

Meridian are parallels to srotas in Ayurveda but not limited to 14, is unlimited/
infinite. Thus it is a segment of Ayurvedic Acupressure treatment but easy and
simple to learn and practice for acute as well as chronic diseases.
