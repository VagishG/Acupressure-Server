Regional treatment based on chinese meridian pathways.

(Ref. article of mag/18-1)

We have to keep in mind the 8 guiding principles of TCM while treatment and
diagnosis. These principles are-

(i) Yin

(ii) Yang

(iii) Excess

(iv) Deficiency

(v) _ Intemal

(vi) External

(vii) Hot

(viii) Cold

These principles have been discussed elaborately in Charak — 3. Also we should
consider and know about TCM concept based on Ki or Chil (Bioenergy), meridians,

physical and metaphysical, Five elements and six energies, time slot of flow of
bioenergy — all can be studied from five element table.

Few examples are sufficient to know about element fire — organ heart — energy
flow time is 11.00 AM to 1.00 Pm (If balanced no heart symptoms but if underactive
heart , may not reflect any symptoms but it will be an uneasy state whereas if hyper
active there will be plethora of heart symptoms such as restlessness, weakness,
palpitation etc. It needs sedation of heart energy, we can apply methi strips on
both IF K joints to balance heart energy and in this case of hyperactivity of heart,
the patient will feel at ease at anti clock time between 11.00 Pm to 1.00 a.m.)
(see Treatise. 1 Page 214 English)

Below is shown, the five element chart with organ clock timings and birth month
related organ. This has been considered in symptoms & treatment in this book.
