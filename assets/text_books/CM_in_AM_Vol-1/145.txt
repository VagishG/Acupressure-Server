the basis of symptoms and it will prove effective. If we are versed in sciences related
to human body, treatment can be broad based. Therefore both common man and
knowledgeable therapists can do treatment but the difference is of the scope.

three as discussed earlier. For example when we have to treat liver disease â€” acute or
chronic , we may consider and rely upon the symptoms and text of Chinese meridians
and related organ, also symptoms: discussed in Ayurvedic system. If we know liver
function and structural defects, it will be an added advantage but it does not mean that
treatment is not possible. Here more emphasis is levied on Chinese wisdom.
