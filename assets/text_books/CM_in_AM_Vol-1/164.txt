Physiologically, there is no such organ as Pericardium or its team mate Tripple
warmer. We have already read two very vital and important team organs — Heart,
small intestine and kidneys, urinary bladder. According to Chinese concept, Pericardium
is combination of above two organ teams. In general it is known as protector of the
heart. In other words, we can say that it arises primarily as an interaction between four
organs — heart/small intestine and kidney/urinary bladder teams. This function is
sometimes called “The circulation - sex” function since it encompasses the entire
vascular system and is closely related to sexual drive.

The Pericardium has several important jobs. It controls emotions, protects
the heart from suffering the effects of serious emotional problems.

Since the pericardium is both heart and kidney teams — related, imbalances in
either, may reflect themselves within this function rather than — or as well as within — the
afflicted physical organ teams. If heart symptoms are manifested —e.g. hiccups, afflicted
speech, being excessively dramatic or emotional, sadness, excessive joy, too much
laughter pains in the heart region etc. The pericardium is treated first.
