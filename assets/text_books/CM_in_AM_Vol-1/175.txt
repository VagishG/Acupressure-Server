CV flows through uterus or gonads (male/female both) down to perineum at CV-
1 and ascends through the genitals and the border of public hair. It also goes up from
public region to navel, larynx, chin and ends on the face below lower lip. Two branches
of this meridian go to St-1 from CV 24 both left and right.
