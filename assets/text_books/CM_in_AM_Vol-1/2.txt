producing wider effect from top to bottom. For example UB meridian starts from inner
corner of each eye, traverses from head, covering whole of the back by double lines,
going down from buttocks to leg to small toe and terminates there. GB meridian starts
from outer corner of each eye and later goes around head, going down through neck
covering side of the body to hips, legs and to toes. Stomach meridian starts from
midway of the lower eye orbit, covering face, goes down from chest, abdomen, pelvis
to side of thighs to index toe, adjacent to big toe. Similarly other important meridians

diaphragm and up to clavicles . Si, Li, P, H, Lu, Tw meridians travel in fingers, palm,
