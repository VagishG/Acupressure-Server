HOW TO TREAT

PF ep =

Now for treatment we may use different modalities and consider following points.
Use of colors, seeds — specially methi, micro magnets (Byol) etc on each joint.
Use of colour or micro magnets or seeds on single points or branch combination.
In this section we will combine to methi or colour covering whole of the joints.

Each joint may be used for acute to chronic diseases. for example whole body
pain only for time being.

(a) Acute Disease - We may use Both MF V joints, application of light blue
colour in winter seasons (By way of tonification) and for whole body pain in
Summer Season green colour on V Joint of both MF (Middle finger) or we
may use methi seed with mild pressure intermittently.This will cover
headache, neck pain, upper and lower backache and leg pain (Sciatica) etc.

(b) Chronic diseases- we may also use light blue colour or methi strip on all
joints of both MF.

Regional treatment on joints by single points — For example we may divide

by 10 because there are 10 points on each joint by Ayurvedic concept.

(a) UB meridian -67/10 = each point covers 7 UB meridian points, approx.
For example- Point no ‘0’ on MF V joint, it can cover frontal and top of the
head. Any problem, pain traumatic or otherwise, we can use violet colour, or
methi or sedation by micro magnet (byol — south pole- yellow side upward).

(b) GB meridian -44 points/10 = 5 points approx.

‘0' point on both ring finger V joint covers frontal and temporal head region
related problems. Treatment can be given in aforesaid manner. Similarly
point no. ‘9’ on the joint will cover GB 40 to GB 44.
