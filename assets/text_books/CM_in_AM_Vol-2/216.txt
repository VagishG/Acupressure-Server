Special Note about Liver :

Liver is the organ of well being. It controls biochemistry of the blood and body.
This organ is responsible for rational, intellectual activity. It is like silent power
behind throne. Even in severe illness, the liver itself is seldom painful (Except
when the gallbladder, its mate is inflamed). In all there are more than 500 functions
and processes as well as early 1000 biochemicalsâ€”that are directly or indirectly
involved in this organ. The liver is most sensitive in the darkest, quitest hours of
the early morning, 1.00-3.00 AM, and is primarily responsible for digestive
functions. Other important functions include the formation, breakdown and

detoxification of blood.
