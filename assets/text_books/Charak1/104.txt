iv) Importance of Finger Joints :

Three clear joints are visible on each finger. It has been clearly established from both
Scientific and philosophical point of view, that the joints are the most specific centre of
energy. This statement has been detailed later. From philosophical point of view in the
Vedas, vaayu only has been accepted as energy. Attribute and function of vaayu is
movement. Residence of vaayu is joints which have superiority of movement. Joints are
mobile, energetic. If there is no mobility, there is no energy. This is an important measure of
diagnosis. The entire body has micro and macro joints which are centreâ€™s of energy. Joints
mean yog and sanyog (sum/total and combine). Several organ and innumerable tissues
merge at a joint and it is a place of union of at least two macro units.It simply means that it
is these joints that distribute and nourish the energy. What is the difference between a
living being and body? The body is lifeless if the joints are immobile; living being is without
vibrations but as opposed to this a living being vibrates and is mobile because of joints
only. The difference between the two is due to consciousness /spirit and joint is a measure
of spirit. From scientific point of view, based on physiology and anatomy three are three
types of joints which have been classified as :

1. Fibrous joints

2. Cartilaginous joints

3. Synovial joints

Fibrous are also called fixed joints i.e., teeth joints between maxima and mandible etc.
Cartilaginous joints have some movement but synovial joints have maximum movements.
Joints of Vertebral bodies of spine are under the cartilaginous category. Pubic symphysis
is also a cartilaginous joint. Similarly, synovial joints are mainly in the leg joints, here the
function of synovial fluid is lubricating the joints. In the body, based on ten types of
movements, joints have been defined as below

1. Flexon
Extension
Aduction
Abduction
Circumflexion
Rotation
