The difference between living and non-living is due to energy and energy appears due
to mobility and the residence of mobility is joints. It is possible by Ayurvedic meridians to
recognize the routes of ailment and later change their way, there by evacuate the toxins.

According to Ayuvedic similarity principle distal joint of each finger is vaata joint (V
Jt), medial joint is pitta joint (P Jt) and proximal joint is imagined as kapha joint (K Jt) and
nomenclature is done according to that. These joints are imagined as representative of ten
meridians of vertical, horizontal, and spiral in sequence. As describe before that each joint
is a dense form of energy and their representative are the rarified form of energy as
mentioned above.

On each finger, among the three joints each distal joint represents ten vertical
meridians. The proximal joints for horizontal meridians and the middle joints are available
for spiral meridians. This concept is based on Korea’s Prof. Park Jae Woo’s thinking who
termed the Chinese Yin/Yang principle into Homo/Hetero and extended it to establish their
controlling force as a Neutro force.

There is no if and but in the structures made by God. In each finger there are three
joints but in thumb there are two joints- at primary level it appears different from fingers.
Perhaps the position of thumb is different but also has similarity. Third joint of thumb can be
seen at the wrist joint clearly. But according to energy the correspondence of head is on
the thumb and ailments of head are mainly based on vaata and kapha. According to
physiology, metabolic activities mostly takes place in abdomen and due to minimum in
head, vaata and pitta joint are placed in distal joint of thumb from perspective of treatment.
So, there are ten vertical meridian, ten horizontal meridian and ten spiral meridian of each
finger, as shown in diagram given below.
