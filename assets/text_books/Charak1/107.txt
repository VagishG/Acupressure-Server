In the creation and operation of plasma etc tissues produced in stomach, small Intestine,
Large Intestine, Gall Bladder, Urinary Bladder, which are considered as exclusive organs
of the GIT also in the creation of principle tissues like blood produced by plasma, Lungs,
Heart, Liver, Kidneys and Spleen have been accepted as responsible organs of
physiological principle; accordingly, oriental scholars have accepted Acupuncture/
Acupressure principles to establish the aforesaid GIT organs as (hollow-Fu)organs and
Heart etc. as(solid-zang) organs. The conctusion of all Theories and principles is that the
creation of Blood is not the sole responsiblility of only one organ but all the organs contribute
to it. The way in the creation of one entity, all contribute in the same way in the development
of an ailment all are responsible and so for its relief/cure it is necessary to treat all the
organs; if only one organ is treated, the disease may not be cured. This Ayurvedic
Knowledge has a specialized (Samvaya) integrated thought that, no individual organ and
development or deterioration- is possible. For Heart ailments, if only Heart is treated, then
it will only be one sided. For Heart ailments, all organs i.e. Liv, Sp, Lu, Si-all organs integrated
diagnosis and treatment is possible and so for each organ different meridian and different

protocols are available.
