As clear from the above diagram, the yang organs (active at times) are plotted on the
vata joints while the yin organs(active always) are plotted on the kapha joints.

Hence, an effort has been made to plot the branch meridians i.e. 10 VMs related to
each yang organ and 10 HZMs related to each yin organ. The examples of plottings of 10
VMs of stomach, Li, Si are given here. Their detailed diagrams are given in Ayurvedic
Treatment Handbook vol-2, pages 105-118.
