Then the question arose as who would go to lord indra to ask the solution to these
problems? Hence bharadwaj stood up and seeked the approval of the rishis that he would
like to go for this work.

Bhardwaj went to the kingdom of lord indra and saw the enlightened (glaze like fire)
Lord Indra, sitting among rishis and devtas(lords).

Thenafter he went near and said words of praise about Lord Indra; presented
intelligently his purpose of visit. Oh! Lord Indra, a number of illness are worrying the mass
of humanity these days, hence please grant a solution for it.

Listening to his prayer, Lord Indra r :alised the potent mind of Bhardwaj and narrated
him the ayurvedic sutras(principles) .

2) Importance of Ayurveda:

(Shlok-24 Pg.-9 (H))

Lord Indra gave the preaching of the entire ayurvedic text to mahrishi Bhardwaj. He
stated: Ayurveda is related to both the healthy and the diseased. It is composed of three
sutras(principles): 1. Hetu(cause), 2. Ling(symptoms) , 3. Aushadh( medicines) and is
omnipresent and is beneficial to all. This Ayurveda was knowr/ visualised by the creator
lord brahma himself.

(Shlok-25, 26 Pg.-10 (H))

Maharishi bharadwaj soon received the infinite and three principled knowledge
(hetu,ling,aushadh) with full concentration and in a sequenced manner. By receiving this
knowledge, Bhardwaj attained a pleasant and long life. Thereafter he distributed this
knowledge (in complete form) to other rishis.
