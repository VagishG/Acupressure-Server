In brief, the vertical meridians are used in physical changes and organ language like
stomach’s belching, gallbladder’s hiccup, pelvic colons flatulence etc. and on colours of
these organs, treatment will be effective on vertical meridians. Paired organs like two lungs,
two kidneys, Liver and Spleen (paired organs of colouration), two lobes of prostrate, two
ovaries and such paired organs whose main function as per scientific point of view is
chemical, this treatment is based on horizontal meridians. e.g. kidney and liver/spleen.
Their main function is based on metabolism. These organs are operators of various body
chemicals like paired lungs are for chemical change in gases, pair of kidney is for excretory
functions. Thus horizontal meridians will treat chemical configuration of horizontal level.

The diagnosis of the vertical meridians is done by checking/pressing the points at the
base of chin bone. They are shown in the figure below:

Lower Neck Girdle

Diagnosis of meridians : The testing of which meridian is affected can be known by
pressing the “0” point of the vertical, Horizontal or spiral meridian on the thumb or fingers.
Also as illustrated above , the relation of meridian with the joints like —

Vertical meridians related to Vata joint

Horizontal meridians related to Pitta joint

Spiral meridians related to Kapha joint

Hence the affected Vm,HZM, SPM can also be known by pressing 10 points on the
respective joints. For example, if one finds node / pain on point number “8” of F-3-V jt, then
select F-3-8 VM(as vata joint related to vms) ; similarly if F-3-P jt point 6 affected, select F-
3-6spm (as pitta joint related to spm) ; and if F-3-K jt , point 4 affected, select F-3-4 hzm(as
kapha joint related to hzms).
