Ten Spiral Meridians (Location Chart)
(SprM) — Normal Flow (NF)

Example - To locate any point on 3“ Spm -

a) Go to spiral meridian - row 4 (3° Spm)

b) To locate point No. 7 on 3“ Spm - search in row of 3° Spm, the No. 7. It is in the column of
8" VM. So 7" point of 3° Spm will be 7th pt. of 8th VM.

Similarly 5" point of 3° Spm is the 5" point of 1 VM as shown in the chart above.
