vii) Direction and Plotting of points on Ayurvedic meridians

For treatment by Acupuncture, the direction of energy is an important aspect. As we
know, the brain energy is the divine centre and it appears through action and sense organs.
Hence, based on the measurement of palms five fingers (especially thumb which
corresponds to head/brain) energy measurement is possible. In palms, the free movement
of thumb from central line, outside and inside, is considered as the basis for energy flow.
Thus in each joint of the finger, the contracted/passive/yin/homo energies (1,4,5,8) are
placed towards the thumb side while the expansive/active/yang/hetro energies(2,3,6,7)
are placed in opposite direction.
