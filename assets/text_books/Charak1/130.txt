As per the above diagram, the energy number is given to the fingers based on their
size. For instance, 0,9 energies are plotted on the thumbs as they both are the
controllers. As per functions, our right hand is continuous in activity while the left
one is seldom used. Hence on the right hand fingers continous passive energies
(1,4,5,8) are plotted while on the left , the active energies(2,3,6,7) are plotted. The
lowest energy level is of akash and vayu (1,2). Hence they plotted on the smallest
fingers; bigger to them are agni-jal(3,4) on index fingers; further big are parthiv-
kaal(5,6) on ring fingers and the biggest mann-disha(7,8) on middle fingers. Thus
the ten fingers-toes are used in treatment based on the ten origin principle.

3. Third Level: At this level, both hands and both legs have ten/ten i.e. 20 fingers/

toes.
2 hands x 5 fingers = 10
2 feet x 5 toes = 10
10+10=20

As described above, based on the Tri-origin principle, the ten origins are itself divided
into two parts (10410). These are available for both, common and specific treatment. Similarly,
fingers even through mainly specific yet are again based on common / specific e.g. primary
and secondary.

The treatment of the body is normally possible by either the fingers or ten toes but
specially treatment of ailments above the diaphragm by fingers and below the diaphragm
by toes has been found to be more effective. Specific treatment of pre natal diseases by
fingers and post natal diseases by toes can be done. Similarly, when the sympathetic
nervous system is affected, fingers can be used. As we know , due to external atmospheric
changes, seasonal aliments are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (fingers)
and ailments related to bodies internal atmospheric condition can be done through the
parasympathetic i.e. legs & toes. This is tabled below.
