has presented several revolutionary concepts. This energy cycle has been divided into
three axes Front/ back as sagittal- , left-right as horizontal and top-bottom as vertical axis.
This really implies that the lines shown on the map are present in a plane, body whereas
has an energy cycle and despite being most micro are important energy meridians. This
inner part is considered as meridian and outer part as border meridian. It may be mentioned
here that in the middle of this body is an energy pillar around which the body is born; this
energy flows in the body in spiral form. According to Indian Scriptures, this important
energy cycle which is Tri -Conceptual is a Tri-origin important combination of Sushumna

Actually even though complete correspondence exists between the cosmos world’s
map and the living human body, yet there is major difference that while the map is lifeless
entirely, the imaginary lines on the human body are alive and called meridians. In Chinese
practice, only longitudinal lines are imagined but Prof.Park in the human body's map, has
imagined Horizontal and spiral lines also making a Tri-origin network. The intersection
points of these lines are termed as ‘Chakras’. Compressively, Chakra is dense source
of energy, whereas meridian is rarified source. In the meridian flow of energy is in one
direction only whereas in a Chakra energy flows in several directions, It's power is several
times bigger than that of a meridian. Points on a meridian are energy reservoirs, but ina
section, points of several energies (as in case of chakras) are infinite sources of energy.
In Yoga, 88000 chakras have been stated. These chakras are distributed all over the body
in the same way as stars in the sky. These Chakras, actually are situated in the body as
