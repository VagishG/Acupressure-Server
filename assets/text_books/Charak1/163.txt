ara erie feearOr err Ree, & ere

According to Ayurveda, out of infinite holes in the body, nine holes are main major
holes of which seven are on the face and remaining on lower part of the body. Holes on the
face will be talked as sense organs also, but the 2 ears, 2 nostrils, and 1 mouth-these
seven on the face and 2 in lower body- urine and stool exit holes-these nine have been
accepted as body holes. The origin of these is the Navel which is most important. At first
sight, navel does not appear as a hole, but when an infant is born and separated from
mother’s chord, and so by cutting from mother’s chord, an independent entity is born. All
these have been clearly indicated in the table below :
