6) Basis of Origin of Nail chakras

In acupressure treatment therapy, while identifying the energy regions, meridians,
chakras and organ correspondences have been considered extremely important. In these,
each has infinite number of divisions according to Ayurvedic principles, but based on the
principle of demarcation. According to divisions, clarification on 1-10 is the basis of the
book. Earlier, we have judged the meridians, correspondences, chakras, finger joints as
enormous areas of energy. In fact, here the tips of the ten fingers have the mini centers of
dense energy location and these are surrounded by the naiis. These have been described
as follows:-

“Nail chakras are dense forms of energy in finger /toe tips covered by nails, which are
sub tissue of bone/bone marrow/ reproductive tissue. These represent the head which in
itself is the biggest energy centre, controlling the entire body, where as each nail chakra
works as a unit as well as a segment of the macro energy field, as each finger represents
the different elements(dravyas)/ origin into 10, representing the infinity.”

By phenomenon of interaction and interconnection of ayurvedic principles, the head
is represented by its extremities(hand and feet), which are in turn connected with the
abdomen. Thus each nail chakra represents the 10 segments of the brain as well as 10
segments of chest and abdomen, alongwith the 10 divisioris of extremities.
