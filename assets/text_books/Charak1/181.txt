8) Sub- division of organs as meridians

Based on an organs structure, each one has been divided into ten sub parts for the
purpose of diagnosis and treatment. On this basis, using minimum acu-points, most
effective treatment can be done.

Here sketches and protocols for treatment of only a few organs are given here. For
others, research is continuing. Stomach related ten sub parts meridians are presented on
the right hands ring finger :

Rt RF 10 VM 10 Parts of Stomach
St- OVM Cavity
1VM Oesophagus- Stomach Junction
2VM Cardiac Sphincter
3 VM Fundus
4VM Body
5 VM Lesser Curvature
6 VM Greater Curvature
7VM Pyloric Antrum
8VM Pyloric Sphincter
9VM Stomach- Duodenum Junction

Sub-division of small Intestine is plotted on left small finger of 10 VM which are
classified as below :

LtSF 10VM 10 Parts of Small Intestine
Sl- OVM Duodenum + Stomach Junction
1VM Ascending Part
2VM Horizontal Part
3VM Curvature Upper
4VM Descending Part
5 VM Curvature Lower
6VM Duodenum + Jejunum
7VM Jejunum
8VM lleum
9VM lleo-Caecum

10 Sub-division of Large-Intestine is plotted on right small finger of 10 VM which are
classified as below :
