11) Regions of brain on fingers/Toes Phalanges :

During the description of meridians, it was seen that meridians starting from head
region touch the head, then chest & abdomen & spread in arms & leg regions. In the
segment classification of brain, one has to differenciate changes which have taken place
in specific regions of the brain, those causes would also have to be necessarily borne in
mind. Actually, physical disease that starts in a region, could be due to energy blocked or
fibroid or both. Treatment through meridians is mainly metaphysical but at a macro level is
physical, hence, treatment is mainly physical but at a macro level is metaphysical. Brain is
basically a metaphysical region, hence, treatment based on brain’s regional classification
is a physical treatment therapy on a metaphysical region. While dynamic, the brain is
various regions, it is necessary to keep in mind the single and duo-principles.

As shown in the following sketches, the brain is being divided by 10 lines into 8 parts;
it can be compared to a melon divided into 8 parts of which each part is divided into three

parts each-vata, pitta & kapha. Thus specified minutest treatment can be done.
