Regional division of the Head

The above regions have been classified 1 to 8 based on the two hands & fingers, by
leaving both the thumbs.

The main basis of clarification is starting from the vertex of head, then to the middle of
eye brows, through the nose, chin and similarly as the back from vertex, then to the centre
of cervical bone again from vertex to the ears, then lower to the neck-thus dividing the
brain region with equal 8 parts.

Based on physiology, the brain has been classified into the following 8 parts :-

a) Right Frontal Region

b) Left Frontal Region
c) Left Parietal Region

d) Right Parietal Region
e) Right Temporal Region
f) Left Temporal Region
g) Left Occipital Region
h) Right Occipital Region
