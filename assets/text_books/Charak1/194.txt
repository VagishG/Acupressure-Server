The nature of the elements to remain with their properties/ attributes is called samvaay/
togetherness. It is continuous and everlasting because where ever the element will be, its
property has to be.

Each element is inseparable with its respective energy. Akash’s energy is shabd/
sound; Vayu’s is sparsh/touch; Agni is ‘ Roop/radiance; Jal’s is ‘Ras/taste’ Prathvi is ‘Gandh/
smell and the related sense organs are ear, skin, eyes, tongue, nose, Thus, each element
has a combination with a sense organ. Similarly, the remaining elements Kaal, Disha,
Mann, Atma & Tam have the respective hole and the action organs. It is clear that from
Akash to mann all elements are the actors for Atma who is their operator. In Ayurveda,
Atma manifests as bundle of unmanifested energy. It is this that enables all elements, to
receive energy which makes all elements to perform based on their attributes and function.
From the above analysis, it is clear that element, energy & organs have relation with each
other and their healthy/sickness also is inseparable. Due to the imbalance in an element,
organs also are effected. Due to the organs, the elements are effected. This thought is
wonderful from the treatment point of view. Successful results have been obtained by their
use at the sansthan.

Based on the attributes and function, the distribution of related treatment regions has
been done on the pitta joint of the related element as tabulated below.
