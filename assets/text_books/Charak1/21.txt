To summarise the nature of vaata — Vata is a principle of movement. “That which
moves” is called vaata. Therefore, vaata may be translated as “air controller of body”.
However, the element of air in the external atmosphere is not the same as the air in the
body. Bodily air or vaata, may be characterised as the subtle energy that governs biological
movement. This biological principle of movement engenders all subtle charges in the
metabolism. Vaata is formed from two elements — Ether and Air.Vaata governs breathing,
blinking of eyelids, movement in muscles and tissues, pulsation in the heart, all expansion
and contraction, the movements of cytoplasm and the cell membrane, and the movement
of the single impulses in nerve cells. Vaata also governs such feelings and emotions as
freshness, nervousness, fear, anxiety, pain, tremors and spasms. The large intestine,
pelvic cavity bones, skin, ears and thighs are the seeds of vaata.

Vaata is also responsible for various urges, namely:

1) Todefecate 2) To pass gas
3) Tourinate 4) To sneeze
5) Tobelch 6) To yawn

7) Tovomit 8) Toeat

9) Todrink 10) To dry

11) Tosleep 12) To ejaculate

If any of urge is imbalanced, treatment of vaata must be there.
