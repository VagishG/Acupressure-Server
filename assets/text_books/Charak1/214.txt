they mixed together and also increase the bunch (commonness leading to growth);
hence now the quantity of wheat seeds has increased than before.

Common.- This establishes uniformity and similarity among all elements. For
example, man, animals, birds, trees, plants are all living beings, as they all are with
energy or life. Energy is common in all living beings, hence similarity is manifested
in all.

Specific- Opposite of common is specific. This distinguishes one element from
another. Like that defined in above example, man, animals, birds, trees all are elements
and all are living beings, but they all are different from one another based on their
functions and attributes, form and shape etc. For the knowledge and identification
of an element, both common and specific attributes act complementary to each
other, they should not be considered as opposite to each other. In acupressure
therapy, for any disease or cause of a disease or in respect of the body or any of its
part or for each element/substance it is necessary to learn and to classify them on
the basis of their common/specific properties.

For example- if a person is suffering from vertigo. Vertigo can be due to any cause,
e€.g. anaemia, cervical spondylitis, insomnia or sleep disorder, brain disorders or
degeneration of any tissue. In all these disorders, the disease symptoms are common
but for proper diagnosis and treatment its specific disease analysis will be essential.
