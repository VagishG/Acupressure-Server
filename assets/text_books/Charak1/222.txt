including paper which serves for the diffusion of knowledge, with perfumes and precious
essences,with fibre for making cloth and with green manure to keep our soil healthy. The
beauty of plants, specially of flowers, uplifts our emotions, we recognise the masterly touch
of creation in them. The planting of forests and parks for recreation and enjoyment and the
loving care of plants for the welfare of all living creatures is much a part of true phytotherapy
as the preparation and administration of herbal extracts, powders or pills. In a similar way
Ayurveda embrances all aspects of well being of living creatures, physical, mental and
spiritual. Life ‘Ayus' is defined as a combination (togetherness) of body, sense organs,
mind and soul.”

The concept of true balance does not only imply correct functioning of our system
and organs, psyche and spirit, but Ayurveda also seeks balance and creative relationship
between

‘us' and with our ‘fellow creatures’

with ‘nature’ as a whole

between our ‘family members and ourselves'

between our ‘friends and ourselves'

between our ‘work and ourselves'

between our ‘climate and ourselves'

between our ‘civilization’ we live in and ourselves

between our ‘ideas and customs’ and ourselves

between 'truth' and ourselves

between 'God' and ourselves and so forth.

It is therefore, not surprising that Ayrveda should be concerned with every possible
aspect of life. As one of the great Mother Sciences, it developed many branches, and it is
not only concerned with the well being of humans but also of animals and plants. "Charak"
defines Ayurved as :

"Science through the help of which one can obtain knowledge about the useful and

harmful types of life, happy and miserable types of life, things which are useful and

harmful for such types of life, the span of life, and the very nature of life".
