and even divorce. To inculcate righteous habits, constant practice is most
important. The Satva is established, then Raj and Tam automatically start
dwelling. Raj and Tam are less harmful for others but are suicidal for oneself.
If once the child is told to answer an outsider that, Papa is not at home (even
when he was at home), then this self planted root of Raj will be a cause of
destruction not only for the child itself (when he grows up) but for the whole
family. The importance of Practice has been stressed directly and indirectly
by Sant Tulsidasji in the epic Ramcharit Manas, that practice is such an
attribute that it makes even a fool into a learned person. Satvic activities lead
a person to moksha(salvation), whereas Rajsik and Tamsik acts lead and
bind one to the cycle of death and rebirth. Ayurvedaâ€™s principle philosophy is
redemption of human suffering. During the last 8-10 years, we have seen
several patients whose illness could not be cured despite of all the therapies.
Such karmic ailments(illness due to wrong deeds) are not cured by any therapy,
but rather they destroy the elegacy of that treatment methods also. These
ailments can be controlled, if the sins of the related patient is eliminated and
this is feasible by Knowledge(gyan), meditation(tapp) etc. This has been
elaborated in the following shlok:

(Shlok-116, Pg.-826 (H))

The deeds/ activities done in the past life are termed as daiv/bhagya/destiny.
This, destiny has also been found to be a causative factor of many illnesses
of this life.

There is no such small or big deed / action, whose reaction, one has not to
face. The karmic disorders (due to deeds) are the destroyers of healing
systems. Hence they themselves get healed when the ill effects of karrnas/
deeds are over.
