In words of "T.T. Svoboda"

"Inherently Ayurveda and Chinese medicine both explain in their own terms health and
illness and each offers direction for regaining health, since they share much common
ground, each can enhance certain themes and expand the vision of the other, and
hopefully through this work new ideas will emerge which can intellectually cross-fertilize
students & practitioners of both systems, perhaps ultimately these two energetic
paradigms can be reconciled not by a wholesale incorporation of one tradition into the
other but, as has happened over centuries, by an exchange of ideas, techniques and
principles. Reconciliation will require that the proponents of both systems, remain
open minded, willing to reflect objectively on the strengths and weaknesses of their
respective fields"
