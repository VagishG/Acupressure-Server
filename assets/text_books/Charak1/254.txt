support to make the body free from diseases. The way the 2/3rd of the cosmos consists of
Water, in the same way 2/3rd of our body has Water element. Hence out of the total intake
of food 3/4th should b√© Water element. So every day 3-litres of water should be taken in.

As the Water element functions to combine with the previous elements in sequence
(Akash, Vaayu, Fire), its other function is of cleaning. Andaj (born out of eggs) and sprouted
out or excreted from the six levels of skin through sweat, all tre substances that appear in
the form of rashes, scurry etc. out of the skin pores are excrete out of the body mainly
through the medium of Water element. To excrete out the pus from the complicated structure
on the inside of the ear, tears from the eyes, secretions from the nose, saliva dropping
from the mouth, all indicate of some toxins been removed from inside the brain and help in
the diagnosis of chronic ailments. White secretions or scales or rashes/ scurvy etc. in
axilla, gonads and from head - hair pores etc. like that sticky secretion from naval,
leucorrhoea(white discharge) from vagina are indications of acute and serious ailments.

3rd component is Water, in the same way in the body its creative function is 2/3rd and is an
important constituent.

In human life, Water is a symbol of love. Fire destroys the organ where it resides,
whereas Water is another form of love, therefore, Water saves their residence from
destruction by controlling the Fire / heat. Water also creates a base for use by combining
in a proper quantity. If the quantity of Water is more than required, dough will not be formed.
Only when dry flour and Water are mixed in proper quantity, only then it can be useful.
Flour is like earth element (soil) but when it combines with Water, it is easy to make bread
and when it combines with Fire it becomes a Panjiri (roasted flour).Earth element itself is
