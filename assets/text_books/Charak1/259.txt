All foods or vegetables are related to earth but even as earth, some have dominance
of Vaayu, some have Akash, some have Fire, some have Water. On that basis, Amla,
cucumber, sweet-gourd, pumpkin, and potatoes nature is decided.

When consciousness is lost for ever, the body is called earthly(Parthiv). For such
bodies, last rituals are performed by cremation, burying inside the earth or by immersing in
a river. A Parthiv body's tissues in some form or other become a part of the earth, and in
time after transformation again forms element. This process is continuous and similar
processes constantly take place in the human body also.

These facts have been indicated here only to highlight that in respect of Earth and in
respect of all the elements, Ayurvedaâ€™s theories and principies are rational and near totality.
Their use in therapies specially, acupressure/ acupuncture, which are based on elements
/ energy is extremely necessary.

Thus with several examples, the earth element can be identified in both cosmos and
body. The earth element is last of the five elements and it incorporates all attribute / functions
of the earlier four elements. So it presents extremely stable- functions and energy- odour
(smell).
