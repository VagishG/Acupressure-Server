To understand the physical form of direction one can have the example of the network
of roads in a city which are meant physically for movement of people, vehicles etc. to and
fro as a pathway. These paths are also of several types. Some ina city, link one colony to
another, some from one ward to another, some from one house to another and in same
form or the other, are present as a means of communication. Without a proper sense of
direction (dishabodh), no one can reach the destination by just following a route. If
somebody's sense of direction is inactive or less effective, he always chooses a wrong
route and wastes his time & energy. If the distance between the house & his school is one
kilometer, the student will normally take 15 minutes to cover the distance; but this time will
considerably be maximum if the student loses the way or takes a wrong route, or speed is
slow, again, if he covers the distance running madly, he will cover the distance in much
shorter time but will be wasting his energy; in both the situations, taking more time or less
time indicates an ineffective sense of direction which is directed to the brain. Obviously, in
the body, the physical organ of direction is definitely present as a part of the brain.
