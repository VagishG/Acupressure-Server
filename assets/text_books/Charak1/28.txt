Body expels the heat, 60% by radiation from the skin, 15% by convection and 25% in
the form of sweat by the skin and in the form of water vapour by lungs. To maintain body
heat in accurate quantity, leading contribution is of the skin.

When the percentage of sweat is excess than 25%, then excess sweating is developed
as an ailment and due to increase in activity of lungs, blood circulation is affected.More
oxygen is needed, because body metabolism, based on oxygen, is affected because of
that pigmentation in skin of the body is also affected. White spots appear in the body
locally, called as Leucoderma. Different types of skin related diseases occur because of

Malpigian layer. Cells at this level have pigments known as melanin. Colour of this pigment
is black. If the number of these pigments is excess in this level of skin then the colour of
skin becomes more blackish. Sunlight is helpful in creating this, therefore the citizens of
hot countries are of black colour.If colour of the skin turns white in India that person is
called â€œSuryamukhi"(facing the sun). Production of melanin depends upon caste and country.
Quantity of this is excessive in negro persons and deficient in citizens of North Europe.
