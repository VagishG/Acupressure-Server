Nervous and hormonal function of vaata [1+2] is the creator of every function inside
the body. Pitta, through its metabolic activities, generates the basic elements required for
the production of body tissues. From these basic elements, the kapha generates the new
tissues and repairs the old ones through its anabolic activity. Hence, the physical attributes
of kapha are opposite from the kinetic attributes of vaata. However, there is a similarity
between the functions of vaata and kapha â€” their functions are different from that of fire and
both have cold attributes in common.
