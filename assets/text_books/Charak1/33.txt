‘aecaa ferred a sha sry sft acter’ | (Shlok-, Pg.-379 (H))
The one which moistens the food is known as kledak.

The word ‘kledaka’ has been derived from the ‘klid’ verb and ‘naka’ suffix of the Sanskrit
language. Klid means ‘to moisten’. It moistens the food hence it is called kledaka kapha. The
fluid secreting from the walls of gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) is called mucin. It helps in the
digestion and movement of food in the GIT. From the point of view of chemical composition,
it is a combination of glyco-protein. It contains 99% water. At the time of food digestion,
secretion of mucin is from 2 to 3.5 litre, of which 2 to 3 litre from stomach wall, 1.2 to 1.5 litre
from pancreas and 1 to 2 litre from intestines. It moistens and softens the food material.
Apart from this, its mucus content by the effect of acid kills the bacteria amp n-s*aeas ine

stomach and intestines. The watery part of mucin is absorbed by the large intestine.

Adequate quantity of mucin is necessary for proper digestion, otherwise its deficiency
increases acidity in the stomach and intestines, causing-

1) Gastritis and peptic ulcer in the stomach

2) Duodenal ulcer or enteritis, etc. in duodenum. Its excess also generates diseases
from acute to chronic level in the digestive system. Diseases occurring due to imbalance
in kledaka kapha are- 1) Slow digestion, 2) Fullness, 3) Excess mucus in stomach.

(2) Avalambaka Kapha
