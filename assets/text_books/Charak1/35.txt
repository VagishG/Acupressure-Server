the job of dissolving the substances entering the mouth. Dry substances dissolve in these
rasa and those substances which do not dissolve, their taste cannot be recognised. The
function of tongue is controlled by one of the cranial nerves, glasso-pharyngeal. Due to its
disconnection from the tongue, the brain is unable to recognise any kind of taste. This task
of transferring the impulse through the nerves is of the vaata, and not of the bodhaka
kapha. Bodhaka kapha dissolves the substances in the mouth and stimulates the nerves
present in tongue to receive the knowledge of all tastes and by these nerve impulses, brain
assesses the tastes that we mention as knowledge of taste (rasa-gyaan). Senses could
not accept the knowledge of their subjects (like taste, touch, smell, etc.) without the

combination of the mind.
Symptoms of imbalance of bodhaka kapha:
1) Obesity
2) Food sensitivity
3) Congestion
4) Diabetes
5) Loss of sense of taste
(4) Tarpak Kapha :
(Shlok-, Pg.-379 (H))

The one which holds the heart system and in whose absence the heart beat increases
is known as avalamban.

Forgiveness, patience and non-greediness are the functions of Tarpak kapha. Tarpak
kapha resides in brain. And its functions are to provide lubrication and nutrition at the base
of sense organs that is brain. So sense organs does their work naturally by combining with
mind and centres of thoughts, thinking, and determination in the brain, gets lubrication and
nutrition so mind also can perform its functions.
