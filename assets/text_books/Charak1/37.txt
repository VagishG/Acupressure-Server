Nourishment of the brain from the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) is nil. Main function of
this fluid is of shock observer. It protects the brain by absorbing pressure of brain. If the
quantity of blood flowing in the brain increases, then the quantity of cerebro-spinal fluid
also increases and due to this, internal pressure remains constant. Wastes that are
produced in the brain during metabolic processes are also carried away by the CSF. Thus
the function of CSF is mechanical and it does not accomplish all the functions of Tarpak
kapha but they are managed to some extent. So the producer of nutrient fluids of brain is

Tarpak kapha.

Tarpak kapha is primarily located in the brain, spinal cord and heart. This form of
kapha allows the CSF to form and function normally. Such a condition results in a mental

and physical state of peace, harmony and bliss. This form of kapha also protects memory.

Symptoms of imbalance of Tarpak kapha:

1) — Sinus irritation 2) Headaches
3) Loss of smell 4) Irritability
5) Weak memory 6) Hydrocephalus

7) CSF disorders
(5) Shleshaka kapha :

The one which joins together the joints is known as shleshmak.

Shleshaka kapha is located primarily in the joint as synovial fluid. This form of kapha
brings lubrication and integrity to the joints and other articulation in the body. At the ends of
mobile bone joints there are membranous capsules. There rear part is covered by a thin
layer which is called as synovial membrane. From their cells synovial fluid is excreted

which lubricates the joints. Synovial fluid is produced by Shleshaka kapha.
