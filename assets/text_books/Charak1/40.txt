4) Diagnosis on the basis of Vata, Pitta, Kapha

Diagnosis of the diseases, stages of the diseases, investigation of disease symptoms,
determination of constitution of patients and diseases are most important than the treatment
of diseases. Diagnosis of a disease is a long and important process. If a disease, of any
type, is properly diagnosed then the treatment is very much possible. In Ayurveda ,for the
diagnosis it is very important to know the, Tridosha- Vaata, Pitta, Kapha, Five elements,
Seven tissues, energies related to five elements, synthesis of mind, intellect, body and
soul, sleep, wastes, diet, mental states and dominance of specific emotions because without
them a proper diagnosis of the disease is not possible.

In Classical Chinese Acupuncture, for the diagnosis, following points are essential to
be known. About them various Treatises of Sansthan have dealt in detail. So here, principles
and laws of acupuncture will be discussed briefly.

(1) Five Element Principles

(2) Eight laws of Acupuncture

(i) Yin-Yang

(ii) Deficiency-excess

(iii) Internal-external

(iv) Hot-Cold

All the above principles primarily appear very simple but they are extremely
important in acupuncture therapy. These principles have been explained in detail
in book-Patanjali Yogic Acupuncture of Sansthan.

element (panchmahabhoot) Sense-organs (indriyas), Mind (mann) and Soul (atma)
and therefore causes of disease are written below.
