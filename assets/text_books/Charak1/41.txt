Five elements are the basis of Ayurveda due to above causes, so it is necessary to
study each element. If there is imbalance in one or more than one element the acute and
chronic diseases appear. Hence, for the diagnosis, it is necessary to have detailed
knowledge of all elements. Force, that is responsible for the change, creates Dosha
(imbalanced force) in five elements by joining one to another element.

The five elements combine in parts to form three dynamic forces by interaction called
dosha. Dosha means “that which changes” because doshas are constantly moving in
dynamic balance. Doshas are primary life force or biological humors. They are only found
in life forms and their dynamism is what makes life happen.

Vata :

Aakash (space) and Vayu (air or wind) elements combine for making vaata. Vaayu
means movement, for movement it needs space. As vaayu keeps getting space, the velocity
of speed increases, when speed increases beyond 150 kmph , it is called storm . Vaata
force is responsible for impulse, blood circulation, movement of food, thoughts, and wastes.
Its balanced state makes the body dynamic. Its imbalance gives rise to diseases in the
body, between them important diseases are listed below.
