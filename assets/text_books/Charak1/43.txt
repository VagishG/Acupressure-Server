From the diagnosis point of view every organ and sense organs are to be classified
on the basis of elements and Tridosha. This classification is different due to structure and
function of an organ. There are five levels of body-

1)
2)
3)

4)
5)

Body as a whole unit
Body systems viz-circulatory, digestive, nervous, lymphatic, excretory, respiratory

Body organs (Yin)- liver heart, spleen, kidney, lungs and (Yang)-Gall bladder,
stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary bladder.

Tissue systems- plasma, blood, flesh, fat, bone, bone marrow, semen.
Cell system

At the level of body systems-Blood circulation, excretory system and nervous system
are vaata, digestive system, pitta and lymphatic system is kapha.

At organ level-

(1) Heart, lungs — Vaata
(2) Liver - Pitta

(3) Spleen,Stomach, Small intestine, Large intestine - Kapha

At tissue level-

(1) Muscles — Vaata

(2) Blood - Pitta

(3) Fat/flesh - Kapha

Fire has an important role in balancing temperature of body organs, tissues and cells.
Pitta can be known in several forms in the body. Pitta is responsible for every metabolic
activity that takes place in the body. Pitta has attributes of both fire and water. Temperature
is its main component. For example- water is transformed into ice at a fixed temperature of
0°C andice gets converted to water at temperature above than 0°C. In both these activities,
temperature is important. Similarly all temperature related ailments are Pitta oriented. In the
form of blood, excess quantity of fluid is present in the body. The regulator of its density
and chemical composition are enzymes and hormones.

In our bodies, pitta is manifested by the quality of transformation. Pitta is enzyme,
which digests our food and hormones, which regulates our metabolism. In our mind, the
pitta force is the transformation of chemical/electrical impulses into understood thoughts.
