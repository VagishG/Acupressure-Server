10 Origin Cycle

10-0 Control
Cycle

The above cycles were created during the regular study and research sessions from
2003 onwards. As there are the creative and control cycles in Chinese acupressure system
, SO also they were created in ayurvedic acupressure. As we start from 0, moving towards
left or right, leaving 2 energies, this control and anti control cycles are created. This has
proved to be very useful in controlling the dravyas/ elements.
