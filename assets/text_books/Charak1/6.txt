After the above elaboration, the ten elements had been placed on the ten fingers and
toes for treatment purposes. As per the working of our hands in day to day life, the yin/
continuous/passive energies are placed on right hand fingers( 0,1,4,5,8) while the yang/
seldom used /active energies on the left hand fingers (2,3,6,7,9). The 0,9 as the controlling
energies are placed on the thumb; 1,2 akash-vayu on small fingers(least power),3,4 agni-
jal on index fingers(bit bigger size, more energy), 5,6 prithvi-kaal on ring fingers(further big)
and 7,8 disha-mann on middle fingers(biggest). Their results in treatment are amazing.
The placement of elements on the fingers is based on the property of element and the
size of fingers. The active elements are on left hand while the passive on the right; smaller
energies on smaller fingers while larger ones on bigger fingers; while the controller energies
on the thumbs. Thus is the placement criteria of elements and development of ten origin
treatment platform. ooo
