These similes have been given here for vital-fluids i.e. hormone and their minute
contribution is most important for life. Irregularity in taking food or defective/ diseased small
organs in the mouth as infection in teeth, inflamed tonsils, inhaled polluted air and infection
in any form of food enters in the body; in this condition plasma is infected and lastly semen
will be affected. This can be a cause of infertility in females and impotency in males. In
such situation, to stop the infection of plasma, prolactic treatment is most important. So on
plasma and blood, all tissues are dependent hence treatment should be given on the meridian
of plasma and blood, like shown below-Plasma joint- right index finger pitta (middle) joint
and Blood Joint- left index finger pitta (middle) joint 0 tone (WBM)and 9 sedate(YBM). This
is very important treatment for chronic diseases. It is a common process of treatment. For
specific treatment, 10 meridians of each tissue are shown in the diagram. Each tissue has
a representative meridian which is present on pitta (middle) joint of each finger and 10
spiral meridians are in specific form.

Diagnosis of Imbalances in tissue is possible, by wastes and sub-tissues of body.
