Description of Ojas/vitality- Ojas is that which makes all living beings contented;
That whose absence may produce death; that which is present since conception as sperm-
ova; that which remains as plasma for the foetus; and this ojas is what enters the heart
during its development. This ojas if destroyed, the body is destroyed; it remains in the
heart and holds life; it is the essence of the body (like ghee in milk so also ojas in ras/
plasma); that which sustains life. The heart circulates this very ojas in the arteries , throughout
the body; these ojas channels are also called mahashrotaas (big vessels); it is so because
the end product of ras/plasma is ojas/vitality tissue and the one which nourishes all the
ojas/vital activities of the body are these mahashrotaas.
