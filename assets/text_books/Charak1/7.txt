Physical Body- The physical body is said to be the one in which the chetna dhatu
(soul) has entered, the five elements are manifested and is the balanced state of
dosh(humor), dhatu (tissue) and mall (waste). It is when the tissues are not balanced and
get toxic, the body gets diseased and starts diminishing. The imbalance of tissues is due
to their increase or decrease in quantity , which thereby occurs due to imbalanced organs
or effects of nature.

The dosh(humowr), dhatu(tissue) and mall(waste) are the roots of the body.

In the form of group of five elements, humours (dosha), tissues and waste are the
cause of creation of body. ‘Dooshantiti doshaa’ — one which infects the body is known as
dosha. Body has three dosha — vaata, pitta and kapha.
