are intact in the body, in the same way, complete physical and metaphysical components
of the body, (like cosmos) are present in the form of palms and soles.

From Ayurvedic point of view, study of cosmos and body by the similarity principle,
the creation of a new correspondence takes place, known as Ayurvedic Correspondence.
Being inseparable, (physical and metaphysical) yet mainly based on physical similarity,
this correspondence is being presented as a physical correspondence form.

Thus, if from the correspondence point of view, the palm and sole are restudied,then
based on different regions and numbers, the correspondence and the similarity is observed
as below;

1) As the cosmos exists as a complete unit, in the same way, our body is also a
complete unit. Again ,whatever exists in cosmos or nature, its correspondence
form is visible in some form or the other in human body i.e.”Yathaa bramhaande
tathaa pinde” as is the cosmos, so is the body. A comparison may be made then,
at all levels as, cosmos-body, nature- human being, body- palm/sole etc. whatever
is present in nature, its some form will always be present in the body and whatever
is present in the body ,its similarity in some form or other is present in the palm and
sole. And if there is any difference between them, then it is only in the dimensions,
ie.-

Nature Physical body Correspondence
(First dimension) —> (Second dimension) —> (Third dimension)
