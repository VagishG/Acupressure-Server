2) Inhuman body, mainly two parts are visible- One front portion (yin), and the second-
back portion (yang). In the front, the body can be contracted by bending, but in the
same manner it could not bend backwards to contract. The back part is thus
comparatively stretched and stable. From correspondence point of view this
situation is exactly visible in the palm of hand. By closing the fist (yin position) it
can be bent, but it can not be bent in reverse direction (yang position).

3) In the body, hand and feet can be divided, on the basis of their joints, in three
parts. Three joints of hand are- shoulder joint, elbow joint and wrist joint. In the
same way, three joints of leg are- hip joint, knee joint and ankle joint. This similarity
is perfectly visible in, three-three joints of fingers and toes in palm and soles.
