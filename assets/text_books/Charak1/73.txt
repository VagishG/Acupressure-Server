4) According to number, if we count, human body has four extremities in the form of
two arms and two legs. These four represent similar, thin, long, cylindrical structure,
they can be compared with the four fingers/toes in the palms/soles which also
show similar structure. Based on specific combination, the middle two fingers of
palm and the two middle toes in the soles can be compared to the legs, which are
comparatively long. Whereas the extreme fingers/toes are farthest from the central
axis, and can be compared to the arms.

5) If the human body is viewed as a unit, then from the middle part of the body called
the trunk, five structures appear - two arms, two legs and one head. If this is
compared with the palms and soles, then these also show a middle part, from
which four fingers/toes and one thumb/big toe come out. Hence, in nature five
elements have been recognised as main elements, and our body is also constructed
by these five element, in the same way, the palms and soles also indicate the five
element concepts, automatically.
