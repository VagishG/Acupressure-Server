These six divisions, metaphysically, have been indicated in Ayurveda's body
created by six elements. Apart from the five elements, the sixth element is Brahma
tatva which is said to be the form of soul, this is clear from the following text in
Charaka Samhita ;

Feen-GRrearretaht aRTOTe eT aTeCDAaAS, Ua Va eT NeEMTE: AafeeM: “Gee ee eek THAI |
(Shlok-4, Pg.-897 (H))
Bhagwan Aatrey said to him- The visible components (organs, parts) in this cosmos
are infinite. Some of them are compared here with their physical perspectives.
The six components/ tissues make this lok/cosmos. These are 1.prithvi/earth 2.jal/
water 3.tejas/fire 4. vayu/air 5.akaash/space 6.unmanifested brahma/energy. These
very six components/tissues compose the human body also .

7) If the internal structure of the body is observed, then diaphragm, as a divider, is
seen. Diaphragm is present in the body as a dividing line, dividing the trunk into
two, chest and abdomen. In the palms/soles its correspondence, as a life line, is
easily apparent which, automatically divides the trunk’s correspondence viz. the
palm, into two parts. Incorporating these two parts also separately now we have
,on the number basis , seven main parts of body and palms/soles as shown in the
sketch below;-
