8) From another point of view, the body can be divided by a middle line in four parts-
head, neck, chest and abdomen. As extremities one gets two arms and legs, so

9) According to Ayurveda, human body is created out of nine elements. These are
nine elements-Five elements, Kaal (time), Disha(direction), Mann(mind), and
Atma(soul).

(Shlok-48, Pg.-18 (H))

Akaash/space etc are the five elements (akaash,vayu, agni, jal, prithvi) and atma/
soul, mann/mind, kaal/time, and disha/direction are the collection of nine dravyas/elements.
This group of elements is divided into two- sendriya (dravyas with indriyas/senses) are
called Chetan/active; and nirendriya (dravyas without indriyas/senses) are called achetan/
non living.

The five elements created body is in itself physically visible, but the human body in its
metaphysical form gives it a clearly specific form ,entirely different from other living beings
,in which , different types of specific functions are performed by extra-ordinary brain. Different
parts of this brain are in the form of Time, Direction, Mind and Soul. Their appearance in
physical body of human becomes evident in various activities. The time element, in the
form of nervous system provides a specific rhythm and shape to the five elements. The
Direction element, in the form of hind brain, controls the natural path/route of energy system
