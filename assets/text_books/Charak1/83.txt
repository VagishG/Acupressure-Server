According to Ayurvedic concept infinite and innumerable meridians are confined into
ten. Different forms of these 10 meridians are presented as vertical, horizontal and spiral
meridians. As aforesaid 10 elements are mainly defined in Ayurveda. So each element
relates with one finger. Because each finger has 10 vertical, 10 horizontal and 10 spiral
meridians there are 30 meridians in each finger related with one element. So in ten fingers
total 300 (30 x10) meridians are presented which represents infinite organs and helpful in
treatment. (Their detailed description and diagrams are presented later).

Synonyms of Shrotaas/meridians- These visible and invisible spaces within the
body are termed as shrotas, shira/veins, dhamni/artery, rasaayani/plasma vessels, nadi/
nerves, pantha/pathways, maarg/roads, chidra/holes-covered or uncovered, place,
residence, excretory passages etc. The tissues within and moving in these spaces are
also affected , when these shrotas are affected; also the other related shrotas and tissues
are affected. The diseased shrotas cause the other shrotas to get diseased and the diseased
tissues lead to the disorder of other tissues. In them, the diseased vata, pitta, kapha doshas
make them further diseased.
