(Shlok-6, Pg.-696 (H))

Types of shrotaas/meridians- These shrotaas will be described here -some as
gross forms, some as root cause and some with their aggravated symptoms. This
elaboration will be useful for even the knowledgeable persons of shastraas, as the topics
not depicted here will also be known; and useful for the ignorant and curious persons as
advices. For example : the shrotaas are 1.Pranvaah 2.Udakvaah 3.Annvaah 4.Rasvaah
5.Raktvaah 6.Maansvaah 7.Maedovaah 8.Asthivaah 9.Majjavaah 10.Shukravaah
11.Mutravaah 12. Purishvaah 13.Swaedvaah. These act as meridians for the all pervading
vata, pitta and kapha in the body. Thus the movement of vata etc is also through them.
Similarly this human body is the residence of the living energy soul, mind and all that is
beyond senses. Therefore when the shrotaas/meridians are in their normal state, no disease
permeates the body.

According to Ayurveda, classification of the main meridians, are presented in this
mannar :

(1) Meridian of Life Force (2) Meridian of Fluids

(3) | Meridian of Food (4) Meridian of Plasma

(5) Meridian of blood (6) Meridian of Flesh

(7) Meridian of Adipose Tissue _â€” (8) Meridian of Bone Tissue
(9) | Meridian of Bone Marrow (10) Meridian of Semen

(11) Meridian of Urine (12) Meridian of Stool

(13) Meridian of Sweat

These meridians act like a path for the vaata, pitta and kapha moving all over the
body. Many meridians are not visible by the sense-organs but they are the paths of the
vital energy for mind, soul etc. and which are the means of transportation and residence of
energy or prana. Therefore, when these meridians are in their normal state then body
becomes free from ailments and their improper state makes body ill or diseased.
