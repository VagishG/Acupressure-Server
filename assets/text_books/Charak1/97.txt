World Map

Analysis:

The above sketch represents the entire world. Scientists have termed the central line
as the zero meridian and its left, right, upper and lower parts have divided the entire world
into East, West, North and south- through vertical and horizontal lines. Even though the
zero-meridian is imaginary, yet on this basis, the maps have been prepared and scientists
can define the location of every place, climate, time and distance etc.in a very precise
manner. Based on correspondence principles, by preparing a map, through imaginary
lines, human body as reflecting the cosmos, can be divided into small components, each
component can be studied in great detail. Based on these imaginary lines (meridian), status
of every minute component of the body, blood in them, water in them, nutrients in them etc.
and the direction of the flow of plenty of matters, distance and fluid content in each cell,
temperature, nature of air and ailments can be studied. As mentioned earlier, a living being
is an integration of macro and micro bodies. Similarly, the lines representing the body of
the living being, despite being macro or micro are sensitive. Despite being invisible,
philosophers by their divine vision have visualised them. However Scientists, continue
their research and through Kirlenin Photography, have started accepting their presence.

Therefore, these imaginary lines (meridian) which identify projections of the body are
live and minute parts of the body, up to the cell are capable of explaining in detail.
