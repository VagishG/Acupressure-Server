Generally people say that God (Chetna) is in every particle: in fact, we can say that
each cell has energy. The most micro part of body is a cell i.e., like a point and these
points are an ocean of energy; so we can say that the human body is made of these
points. In a living body, these points are energy points which are the basis of
Acupressure. And several points combine to form an energy channel which the chinese
tcrmed as meridians. And several meridians combine to form an energy system. The
energy points. in Acupressure are called Acupoints. In Ayurvedic Acupressure, Shrota
(Sia) are considered equivalent to meridians.
