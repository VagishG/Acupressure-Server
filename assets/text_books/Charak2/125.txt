After describing the three principles of causes princple, based on form of
Kaal, importance of Kaal and energy force of Ayurveda, are now being
described in detail : ,
Pragya Apradh ( SaTarrer ):
Mind is an atom, is one:
“querer raed at got were: aye”

The function of mind's coordination is this : when the mind coordinates with
skin senses organ (4x4) of the eye orbit, then the person sees. In the
same way, a person experiences the other senses, but the skin sense organ
(waa) becoming active, ensures coordination of mind with all the action
& sense organs. So even if it is one it is still all pervasive (TT%). Therefore
the condition that happens due to proper coordination of mind with all action
& sense organs is called favourable (A121). In this process, excess use
(aifeaht), total disuse (3), wrong use (feat: am) is precisely called
integration of unharmonised five major elements, five action organs, five
sense organs, mind, brain & atma (a7areat sfxaret dah),
