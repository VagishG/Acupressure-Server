Disease & Good Health â€” Causes :

Hence integration of unharmonic resulting in asaatmya indriyarth's sanyog,
pragya apradh & parinam, and the three options atiyog, ayog and mithyayog result in an
abnormality but if the aforesaid three options etc. are in harmony then there would be
good health.

L. Causative Factors :

Three cause of diseases :

Diseases have three causes : (i) Mind & Indriyas' Atiyog, Ayog & Mithyayog

(ii) Karma's (Actions) Atiyog, Ayog & Mithyayog & (iii) Kaal's Atiyog, Ayog

& Mithyayog. Examples are :

i) Eyes : If very brightly lit scenes are seen for a long time, this is eyes'
atiyog. It has been found that some people do sunbathing or taking sun's
rays for long periods- results in & this disease.

Completely avoiding bright light or remaining away from light is ayog
of eye indriya.

Watching bad things, horrible scenes, strange scenes, repulsive scenes
etc. is eyes' mithyayog. By watching such things, many damages are
caused. In modern days, children & adolescents are becoming used to
watching blue films which causes results in physical & character damage
& in the long run results in very serious ailments.

ii) | Ear: Hearing sounds of thunder, drum beating, talks full of ego, shouts
with great anger etc., if heard for long periods, are ears' atiyog; but if the
ears are not able at all to bear such sounds, then this will be ears ayog.
This also can be a cause of disease. Hearing of harsh words, some near
& dear ones' death/destruction or of damaging, disrespectful, fearful
talks etc. are ears' mithyayog.

iii) | Nose: Smell of bitter red chilles, black pepper's smoke, attraction towards
strong scent etc. are atiyog of nose & unable to smell any thing is nose's
ayog. Bad smell, dirty smell, rotting products' smell, or an interest in the
smelling a dead corpse are all nose's mithyayog. In fact, these are totally
unacceptable use & such a person can not be called healthy.
