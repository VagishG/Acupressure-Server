iv) Tongue : Tasty foods and consuming more and more such foods is Atiyog
of Tongue. For example, these days children have developed a lot of
fondness for snacks, fast foods, savoury salty things (az) & sweets and
this can result in diseases in the long run. Similarly not taking or non-
interest of any special tasty foods will be called tongue's Ayog. Again,
by mixing different tasty foods & taking harmful eatables will be
mithyayog of the tongue. \

vy) Skin : Bathing with very cold or very hot water, using creams, ubtan
(34e4) etc. in excess is Atiyog of skin. And complete reverse of the
above is Ayog of skin. But irregular use of cold or hot things for bathing,
getting hurt, touching impure products is mithyayog of skin.

vi) | Touch: sense is the most pervasive (41h) sense organ. In all the five
sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin) the touch sense is the most
pervasive. It is connected to and coordinates with the mind. In Ayurveda,
it has been indicated that skin is most important and the touch sense is
the only one which is connected to all the five senses. In understanding
the touch sense, the role of Mann (44) is very important. In the knowledge
of senses, the role of mind & coordination with it is very important. If
the mind is disturbed, a person can't understand the sense organs.
