Charak Sanhita; Sutra Sthan 3729

Both types of deeds — aa & GeTER — also have weak & strong classification °

because a deed is of three types : bad, ordinary & good. Also, deeds of previous births
or of this life can also be bad, ordinary or good. These types depend on the doer's
habits and so are the results. Good deeds results are never poor or bad or weak.

Other important tri-origins :

Human Body ( Y&® ) tri-origin form (ff1—-eHeMTTH TAT) :

In Ayurveda three factors of human being's nature have been described. These are
greed/ambition/desire for i) life, ii) money, iii) salvation. In the creation of a
human being, the first important thing is to hold the prana (ST) i.e., a holistic
development of each organ/sub-organ of the body and this is a desire for life.
After this desire is fulfilled, to follow the physical world's rules is greed for
money (845M), Through this money earned by education and industry can then be

used for undertaking the religious fulfilments in the world and then achieving
ambition of the last desire of salvation. Achieving desires for the next world is

salvation (eetaM),

Tri Energy (frferer ae) :

According to Ayurveda a human being is dependant on three forces viz., (i) Natural

(SE), (ii) time dependant (es) and routine based (4fth7) meaning taking food

and other activities based on the routine..

(i) Natural Energy - This is the natural energy of body and soul.

(ii) Time Dependant Energy (cts) - This is due to kaal changes i.e., period of
low nutrition of period of liberation. Or due to changes in state - childhood
to adulthood, old age etc.
