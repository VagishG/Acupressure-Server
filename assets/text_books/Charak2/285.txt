Glossary of Nervous System

BRAIN

Amygdala - Part of the telencephalon, located in the temporal lobe. It is
involved in memory, emotion, and fear, essentially acting as the
brainâ€™s warning center. The fight-or-flight response originates
with the amygdala. The amygdala is just beneath the surface of
the front, medial part of the temporal lobe where it causes the
bulge on the surface called the uncus. This is a component of
the limbic system.

Autonomic Nervous - Part of the peripheral nervous system that supplies neural

System connection to glands and smooth muscles of internal organs;
made of two divisions (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and
sometimes is considered to have a third division called the
enteric system.

Axon - Extension from the cell that carries nerve impulses from the cel!
body to other neurons.

Basal Ganglia Group of structures which coordinate movement; located in the

forebrain (telencephalon).

Brain - A multi-layered structure containing billions of neurons and
countless numbers of neuronal connections, thousands of
specialized regions.

Brainstem - Also known as the hindbrain; region of the brain that consists of

the midbrain (tectum, tegmentum), ponds, and medulla;
responsible for functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood
pressure.
