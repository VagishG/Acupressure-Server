Prefrontal Cortex-

Presynaptic -

The most anterior region of the frontal cortex; involved in
problem solving, emotion, and complex thought.

The region of a synapse that releases the neurotransmitter (in
contrast to postsynaptic).

Primary Motor Cortex - Region for initiation of voluntary movement.

Primary Somatosensory Cortex - Region which receives tactile information from

the body.

Primary Visual Cortex - The regin of the occipital cortex where most visual

information first arrives.

The forebrain; lies rostral to the midbrain (mesencephalon);
consists of the telencephalon (cerebral cortex & hippocampus)
and diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus).

Another component of the limbic system. This part is
responsible for familiar motor skills.

The hindbrain; lies caudal to the midbrain (mesencephalon); made
of the metencephalon and myelencephalon.

A furrow of convuluted brain surface (opposite of gyrus).

One of the two systems that compose the autonomic nervous
system; a sympathetic response dilates pupils, inhibits salivation,
relaxes airways, accelerates the heartbeat, inhibits digestion, etc.
The area between one neuron and the next, through which
neurotransmitters are passed which transmit neural messages.
The dorsal portion of the midbrain (mesencephalon).

Ventral part of the midbrain (mesencephalon).

The frontal subdivision of the forebrain, includes the cerebral
hemispheres and the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala.

Located below the frontal and parietal lobes; involved in
perception and recognition of auditory stimuli and memory.
