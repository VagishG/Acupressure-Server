Articular

A large mass of gray matter deeply situated in the forebrain at
the topmost portion of the diencephalon. The structure has
sensory and motor functions. Almost all sensory information
enters this structure where neurons send that information to the
overlying cortex. Axons from every sensory system (except
olfaction) synapse here as the last relay site before the
information reaches the cerebral cortex.

Located in the occipital lobe; involved in detection of simple
visual stimuli

The shiny layer underneath the cortex that consists mostly of
axons with white myelin sheaths (in contrast to gray matter).

SPINE
Sterile bone derived from another human which is used for
grafting procedures.
The outer, fibrous, ring-like portion of an intervertebral disc.

The most rotated vertebra in a curve; the most deviated vertebra
from the patientâ€™s vertical axis.

Inflammation ofa joint usually characterized by swelling, pain.
and restriction of motion.

The fusion of bones across a joint space, thereby limiting or
eliminating movement. It may occur spontaneously or as a result
of a surgical procedure, such as fusion of the spine.

Any disease or disorder involving a joint.
The surgical remodeling of a diseased or damaged joint.

An instrument inserted into a joint cavity to view the interior of
a joint and correct certain abnormalities. An arthroscope is an
endoscope for use in a joint.

Pertaining to a joint.
