Based on these principles, not only has the body been classified into ten parts, but
body's each organ, sense organ, tissues etc. have been classified into ten parts.
Simultaneously, heart's blood vessels into ten parts and that too based on physiology
and allopathic nomenclature and then giving treatment have brought about wonderful
and miraculous results. Similarly, by dividing the eye, noc, ear etc. into ten parts. and
dividing male/female reproductory organs - uterus, prostate into ten parts, their
meridians have been identified. This is a subject of continuous research which is
continued for generations in the future and will be presented as the infinite concepts of
Ayurvedic Acupressure . Presently many ten division concepts have been included in
this book but they are incomplete. Based on these classifications, both diagnosis and
treatment can be done easily. This has been termed as regional treatment.

Ayurveda is a sub-part of Atharva veda and veda is God's voice (seam) which
empowered Ayurveda. The descent of Ayurveda on earth has happened for the transfer
of knowledge by the Rishi-munis for redressal and solution of serious and incurable
mental ailments occuring in this Kaliyug which are beyond the reach of scientists as

depicted from the following shloka in Charak Sanhita :
