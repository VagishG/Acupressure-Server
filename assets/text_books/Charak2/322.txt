3) Attribute similarity - milk helps in increasing semen. So consuming milk
and its products like butter, ghee etc. a man's body becomes healther, stout
fully developed.

Classification of Specific (fasta & Ye) :

1) Dravya Vishesh - if a person is growing fat, then by consuming
products with opposing attributes i.e., dry and Vayu dravyas, the fat element
will reduce.

2) Attribute Vishesh - ifthe body becomes dry, then by massaging with smooth
and oily dravya like oil, body's dryness will reduce.

3) Function Vishesh - if there is increase of mobility increasing vata type

functional excess, then the therapist advises the patient for bed rest, since
for Vata anti is Kapha and bed rest will increase kaph. Slip disc is a case of
excess wind and by taking rest, kaph stagnation increases and slip disc gets
relief; and this rest may be needed by the patient for several months. In
Ayurveda Acupressure by applying points sometimes immediate and
sometimes even in a day or two or even in a week unbelievable relief has
been noticed.
For treatment, during analysis disease's attribute and function and for
treatment, based on panchmahabhoot, analysing their function attribute,
applying related meridian and acu points based on material science, it is
essential to know each mahabhoot's function and attribute; and this has only
been briefly stated in this book since detailed analysis has been done in Charak
Acupressure Part-I.
