Mid Brain (Wear Afttes ) :

1)

2)

Tectum ( Hatt WaE Wee):

This is divided into two sensory centres. One is called inferior colliculi
& the other is called superior colliculi. The activity of vision is performed
by superior colliculi although visual activity is performed by occipital
lobe but in the absence of this lobe, this activity is performed & controlled
by superior colliculi only. The auditor of activity is dependant on inferior
colliculi.

Floor ( aet) :

The lower surface is called floor. This enables the sensory nerves' flow
reach the higher parts of brain and motor nerve flow goes by the same
route to the lower parts of brain.

Hind Brain (aye TftTe ) :

(a)

Pons :

This is the front portion of cerebellum. From its lower part, medulla
oblongata portion of brain starts. This is slightly spread out. In this portion,
nerve fibres from cerebrum enter from one side and exit from the other
side. Due to this traversing, cerebrum's nerve fibres of right hemisphere
activate the nerves of left side muscles and left hemisphere's nerve fibres
activate the nerves of muscles of the right side. Thus, any shock on one
side hemisphere affects the muscles of opposite side. On the back side
of pons, cerebellum is connected by nerve fibres. Thus, pons is a bridge
connecting both parts of cerebellum and the parts of cerebrum; also
connecting the cerebellum & cerebrum with other parts of brain is the
main function of pons. In it are the centres of V, VI & VII cranial nerves.
From here only, some fibres coming out of cells, go to different parts of

the nerval system (afta FSe).
