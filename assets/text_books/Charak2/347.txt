Parasympathetic :

This is also called cranial sacral formation because its nerve cells (qfesar afra-

aif) are found in the brain & spinal cord's sacrum region. It has two parts :
1) Cranial Outflow (sed art)
2) Sacral Outflow (att 31)

Cranial outflow's fibres come out of special centres in brain's pons, medulla &
mid brain; and sacral outlfows' fibres come out from capillaries in third, fourth & fifth
regions of spine. The fibres which come out of the brain, are not of independent nerves:
these fibres are with the third, seventh, ninth & tenth cranial nerves.

Due to stimulation (Â¢3MT) of the fibres in cranial outflows, muscular fibre of
eye's iris contract and size of the pupil is determined; also, motor secretory fibres
reach the salivary glands and provide greater satisfaction in eating; again, hearing also
becomes more pleasant. They reduce heart beat and breathing channels contract. There
is greater secretion from glands in stomach, intestines & pancreas. Due to stimulation
of fibres in the sacral region, contraction of rectum, urinary bladder & anus also
increase.

This system produces the chemical Acetylcholine. Impulses which are transmitted
from junctions of nerve cells & central organ (St dq) from one side to the other are
only due to acetylcholine. Contraction of volantary muscles is also due to acetylcholine;
this chemical is produced by parasympathetic fibres which go to eyes' pupil dilation,
glands, stomach, intestines, urinary bladder etc.

In both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, there are anterior and posterior
fibres. In parasympathetic's anterior & posterior ganglions, the fibres are para
sympathetic. In sympathetic system also the anterior fibres are parasympathetic &
posterior fibres are sympathetic. Organs in which both sympathetic & parasympathetic
fibres go, the action in those organs are contrary to each other as may be seen from the
