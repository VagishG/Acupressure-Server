Brief Notes on Nervous System

1. It detects & responds to changes, inside & outside the body.

N.S. Pa
Central N.S. Peripheral N.S.
Brain Spinal cord — Cranial Spinal

3. The smallest functional unit of N.S. is called as Nerve cell or Neuron.

4. Food for Nerve cells / N.S. is only "glucose". - we *

Nerve cells produce & transmit nerve impulses or electrical charges. VM, ;

Production = "Irritability" Ae
Transmission = — "Conductivity" wr i) a

Range of Impulse conduction = 0.5m/sec to 130m/sec.

Brain tissue = "Neuralgia" which makes '4'" to % of brain tissue. It
is non-excitable & replicates throughout life (unlike nerve cells).

e Acts as supporting tissue of C.N.S.
e Acts as Blood-Brain Barrier.
(Prevents toxins exchange between Blood & Brain).
9. TheC.N.S. (Brain & Spinal cord) is protected by three membranes/ meninges.
10. The most important section of N.S. is that Brain has 4 ventricles (cavity).
e Fromtheir wall is secreted CSF (cerebro spinal fluid) through blood vessls.
e This fluid surrounds & protects the Brain & the spinal cord.
