In the first part of this book Charak-I, only a few points of Ayurvedic vision have
been covered. Among them, the similarity between human being and the divinity, the
ten dravyas which have created the human being, the main factors of a human being viz.,
(common, specific, elements, attributes, functions and integration), human being and
divinity tri-origin form's correspondence has been feasible. In the human body, Ayurvedic
tri-origin form based on physiology and body constitution's similarity and the diseases
with which the human beings suffer three main systems - Nervous, circulation and
digestive systems - effort has been made to treat with very simple methods. The nervous
system exists in every part of the human body and all the cells and organs are thereby
operated. In the human body, a wonderful manufacturing unit is established which, from
the food that is taken, creates various tissues - plasma, blood, flesh, muscle, bone,
bone marrow, semen etc. These, mainly blood, flows in every part of the body and
provides nutrition. The circulation system, through the heart does the distributionof
nutrition through blood. Through blood, every part of the nervous system and the cell
receive nutrition. Thus, the nervous system directs every organ of the digestive system
and the tissues are created. These tissues, through the circulatory system's distribution
provide nutrition to each cell. Hence, the human body as a unit, are dependant as
mentained above, on each other and the three systems have a wonderful coordination.
Any part of this chain, when distrurbed causes the tripod to break causing start of an
ailment. The tripod of these systems can be clarified through the following sketch :
