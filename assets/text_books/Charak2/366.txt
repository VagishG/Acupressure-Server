9) Asmentioned earlier, Acupressure is really needle-free Acupuncture. It has
been defined in various forms as a basis and whatever result and effect can
needle i.e., conventional acupuncture can achieve, same effect and result can
be achieved using small-big byol magnets, three types of bipolar Chakra
magnet and star magnet's cluster.

Treatment by applying colour seeds specially methid seeds or by only applying
pressure, has also proved effective.

10) By applying white byol magnet (WBM - White on upper side) energy is
increased and is called tonification (T) in Acupuncture; conversely by applying
yellow magnet YBM, energy is reduced and is called sedation 4 in Acupuncture.

11) White colour's magnet is north pole and yellow (visible from top) in south
pole. The chakra magnet should also be similarly used; the magnet (white or
yellow) at the centre of the chakra magnet, is similarly for tonification/
sedation and the treatment is done accordingly.

12) By applying colours, the following table should be used.

Each organ's energy has a specific colour. When its own colour is applied on
teh main point of the energy route, then it helps in increasing the energy
flow. Again, by using the organ's subjugator colour, energy flow is reduced
in the energy path.
