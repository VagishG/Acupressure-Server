9) A flaves and reliable method of assessing constitution is by assessing
the state of energy flowing in the meridians. For this the following
methods are adopted.

Using Byol Magnets :

In this method, byol magnets are used to increase or reduce the energy in a
meridian. For this, to increase flow of energy. White byol magnet is applied
on the point in the direction of flow of energy and yellow magnet is applied
on the other point. For sedation, the magnets are reversed.

Using Fingers :
The tips of our fingers have been made natural magnets. Each hand's each
finger tip has effect of either north pole or south pole. Finger tips can be

utilised for this magnet effect and the finger tips can be used exactly the way
the byol magnet was used in the previous methodology.

Through the use of Probe :

Through the Probe (which is a small rod like diagnostic tool), tonification or
sedation of energies done. For this, on the meridian, a specific point is used;
this point is the main acupoint of that meridian. On this point the probe is
kept in an inclined manner and with a slight pressure either in the direction
of or in the opposite direction of flow of energy. If the pressure is given in
the direction of flow, then the flow increases; if the point is pressed in the
direction opposite to the flow, then the flow of energy reduces. So in this
way, on the meridian by increasing or reducing the flow of energy, the ailment
is assessed. See the sketches below :
