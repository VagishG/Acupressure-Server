Increase or Decrease in the symptoms - the patient feels it.
Uneasiness

The patient may feel uneasy and he/she may even say so that he/she is
not feeling well

heaviness in the head/eyes or increase in anyother symptom, it
indicates that there already was excess energy there; and vice versa of

by sedation the above mentioned feelings appear. We can thus, judge
on which meridian there is excess or reduced energy.
