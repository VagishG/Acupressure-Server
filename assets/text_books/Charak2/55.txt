Treatment Analysis :

From Ayurvedic point of view, abnormal lateral curvature is a symptom of
Vayu; softness is a symptom of Jal; and due to intensity of these two elements, takes
the form of combination (A414). Hence, it is desirable to sedate the three elements
(2,4, 74). And hardness is the attribute of Parthiv (5), Agni’s function is cleaning due
to its burning attribute and mann’s function is activity. Hence by toning 3, 5, 8 together
scoliosis i.e., bone's abnormal inclined curvature can gradually be corrected.

At the Sansthan in several patient's treatment in the first and second MRI, the
pain and other symptoms were found underfull control though scoliosis was found
unchanged.
