4) Variation in Vertebral Numbers :

Fusion of cervical vertebrae C, & C, or C, & C, may be associated with a high
riding scapula & cardiac abnomalities. Variations in the number of thoracic vertebrae
are previously dealt with. One of the commonest abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae
is a partial fusion of vertebra L, with the sacrum (sacralization of the lumbar vertebra).
Partial seperation of vertebra S, from the sacrum (lumbarization of first sacral vertebra)
may also occur.

A hemivertebra occurs when a vertebra develops only on one side.

Generally, seven cervical vertebrae get fused and create a special type of disease
and symptoms. Such ailments are also related to raised shoulders and heart disease.
Similarly, two vertebrae in lumbar and sacral region also get fused and create a special
type of disease.

Lumbar L, and Sacrum fusion is called sacralization of lumbar vertebra and
fusion of S, with lumbar vertebra is called lumbarization. When L, fuses with
sacrum, it is called sacralization and when Ss, fuses with lumber, it is called lumbarization
of S,.
