Brain Disorders & Treatment

Based on physiology and structure, brain size, type & functioning has been discussed
earlier in detail. Ailments in its structure & functioning would be known from modern
medical investigations & test reports. However in the absence of test reports,
identification of ailments can be done by Ayurveda's Aaptopdesh (27@102Â¥1) & by visible
& examination of the patient and then treatment can be done. Prima facie. head is the
controller of the entire body, has two eyes, two ears and one nose and indriyas triad.
Based on Ayurveda's Tulyartha knowledge, we can say that our brain's internal structure
can be clearly judged by seeing from separate angles. Brain's right and left hemisphere
are similar to eyes and ears' appearance as horizontal and vertical. Nose corresponds
to the middle of the two hemispheres and can represent corpus callosum. Hence, as
per the sketches below, by dividing the orbits of eye, ear & nose in ten parts ie.,
Ody, covssves 9, they represent ten energy meridians. By pressing on the ten points on
the orbits of eye/ear/nose, diagnosis of specific brain's disorder & treatment can be
done.
