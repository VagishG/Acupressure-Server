Ayurvedic Acupressure

Ayurvedic Acupressure is made of two words - Ayurveda and Acupressure. These
two words again are a combination of two words each. Before describing Ayurvedic
Acupressure, it is necessary to briefly analyse both these words.

Ayurveda is formed of two words : Ayu and Veda. Ayu literally means life (Life
process) and Veda means knowledge. Comprehensively therefore, Ayurveda means
knowledge of every facet of life. Infact, this is the area of Ayurveda. Jiva-Jivan-
Chaitanyata-the integration of these three is the Jivadhari - Prani-'person’. Scriptures
mention 84 lakh species of living beings; these include insects, living beings in the
water, birds and animals, trees and plants and human beings. Of these human being is
the highest level of evolution. In Ayurveda among all the living beings a human being's
description from birth to death has been described. In Ayurveda, it is called Purush
(¥®3) which represents all living beings. The knowledge of Ayurveda incorporates :

fenfed ge gaargerer feafeds |
art a weet aaitmnrgda: Tea
Charak Sanhita; Sutra Sthan 1/41

Where there is description of happy/unhappy (miserable) life, whatever
is beneficial/narmful for life, and yardsticks enunicated where in is known as
Ayurveda.

By the study of Vedas and following it one can obtain quadrant of Purushartha
(Dharma, Artha, Karma and Moksha), in the similar way by virtue of Ayurvedic treatment
and following up the principles laid down there in will impart the effects of Purushartha.
It is all proved by the scriptures. In view of this the Ayurvedic Acupressure was born.
