treatment, when her condition improved, she was brought to the Sansthan. Only one
ailment had remained - vision of one eye. Since eye's vision centres are in brain's
occipital region and according to the sketches above, occipital lobes are in small fingersâ€™
all the three phalanges. By pressing by probe and at the nodes, magnets were applied.
