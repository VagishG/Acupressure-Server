Integration of unharmonious organs (Indriyas), action, sense with their
subjects ( 3TaTeat sfxare dart ) :
In cause principle (¢q 4) apart from Time-Result (#1 RUM), Mental-
Aberration (3a 3714), the Imbalance in Coordination (31ae4 Saar dart)
being an important element in human development, is also a great causative
factor in the onset of diseases. In the body if ten important organs, ten organs
(five-action, five-sense) their subjects : mind, main organs etc., do not function
according to the Energy system (311), then several types of diseases in
different forms develop. In physiology blood and its components have been
given importance; in the same manner in Ayurveda, Tissue, Plasma, Blood,
Skin, Fat, Bone, Bone-Marrow, Ova/Semen are in a set sequence of body
building elements, tissue, sub-tissue & wastes have been considered
important. When all sense organs & main organs are functioning properly in
coordination, then healthy tissues are formed. If even one organ or sense
organ does not function properly, then disease occurs. If its treatment is not
done in time, a chain of diseases keep occuring & the patient turns into a
serious patient. This is indicative of a principle that for a healthy body to
remain so, it is necessary that all organs are functioning in coordination.
This is called a holistic principle. This is a Holistic approach for both diagnosis
and treatment.
Physician ( aq):
For treatment of body, it is not necessary to have several specialists' doctors;
but a well-versed physician is what is necessary. One physician is enough for
Head, Heart, Kidney, Liver, Spleen, Lung, Children diseases, Nervous system,
Blood diseases, Hormone problems, Food treatment, Joint pains, Eye, Nose,
Ear etc., but for this he has to be a competent physician (#4). For a good
physician, Ayurveda specifies the following qualities :
