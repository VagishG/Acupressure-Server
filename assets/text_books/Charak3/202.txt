Charak Sanhita; Sutra Sthan 1/56 PP 27
Soul is pure & faultless. It exists & provides energy to in Mann, Element (Bhoot),
Attributes, Indriyas & Conscience. It witnesses all actions & is all pervasive.
The basis of the world i.e., a human being (s1aT™M) is Mann, Atma & Body. The
root of all diseases, where they grow, are the Mann & Body but Atma is called pure &
it proves that Atma is without disease. Another meaning of pure is neutral in happiness

or sadness. In worldly acts also the soul is happy; it is also spoken these days that for
many reasons, the soul is unhappy.
