Central Sulcus- = The major groove which divides the frontal lobe from the parietal
lobe.

Cerebellum - Structure located in the back of the brain (dorsal to the pons)
involved in central regulation of movement, such as basic
movement, balance, and posture; comes from the latin word
meaning “little brain”; is divided into two hemispheres and has a
cortex.

Cerebral Cortex- The outer covering of the cerebral hemispheres consisting
mostly of nerve cell bodies and branches; involved in functions
such as thought, voluntary movement, language, reasoning, and
perception; the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex are
connected by a thick band of nerve fibers (corpus callosum);
highly grooved or “gyrencephalic” in mammals.

Cerebral Hemispheres - Right and left halves of the forebrain.

Corpus Callosum - The large bundle of axons which connect the two cerebral
hemispheres. It disseminates information from the cerebral
cortex on one side of the brain to the same region on the other

side.

Dendrite - One of the extensions of the cell body that are reception
surfaces of the neuron.

Diencephalon - Part of the midbrain; consists of the thalamus and hypothalamus.

Forebrain - The frontal division of the brain which contains cerebral
hemispheres, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus.

Frontal Lobe - The most anterior portion of the cerebral cortex (in front of the

central sulcus); it is involved in reasoning, planning, parts of
speech, movement, emotions, and problem-solving.

Glial Cells

Nonneuronal brain cells that provide structural, nutritional, and
other supports to the brain.

Areas of the brain that are dominated by cell bodies and have no
myelin covering (in contrast to white matter).
