Gyrencephalic - | When the cerebral cortex is highly folded and convuluted (due
to gyri and sulci).

Gyrus - Raised portion of convuluted brain surface.

Hindbrain - The rear division of the brain, includes the cerebellum, ponds,
and medulla (also called the rhombencephalon).

Hippocampus - The portion of the cerebral hemisphers in basal medial part of
the temporal lobe. This part of the brain is important for learning
and memory . . . for converting short term memory to more
permanent memory, and for recal:ing spatial relationships in
the world about us.

Hypothalamus - Part of the diencephalon, ventral to the thalamus. The structure
is involved in functions including homeostasis, emotion, thirst,
hunger, circadian rhythms, and control of the autonomic nervous
system. In addition, it controls the pituitary.

Limbic System- —_A group of structures including the amygdala and hippocampus
(and others); important for controlling emotions and memory.

Medulla Oblongata- This structure is the caudal-most part of the brain stem, between

/Myelencephalon _ the pons and spinal cord. It is responsible for maintaining vital
body functions, such as breathing and heartrate. See overall NS

organization.
Metencephalon- Subdivision of the hindbrain, which includes the cerebellum and
pons.
Midbrain/ - Middle division of the brain, which includes the tectum and
Mesencephalon tegmentum; involved in functions such as vision, hearing, eye

movement, and body movement.

Motor Cortex - _A region of the cerebral cortex that sends impulses to motor
neurons; involved in coordination of movement; found in the
frontal lobe.

Myelencephalon - Caudal part of the hindbrain, includes the medulla oblongata.

Myelin - Fatty insulation around an axon waich improves the speed of
conduction of nerve impulses.
