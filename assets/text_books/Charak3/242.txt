to the tailbone. It is made up of 33 bones, known as vertebrae.
The first 24 vertebrae are separated by discs known as
intervertebral discs, and bound together by ligaments and
muscles. Five vertebrae are fused together to form the sacrum
and 4 vertebrae are fused together to form the coccyx. The spine
is also referred to as the vertebral column, spinal column, or
backbone.

Inflammation of vertebrae.

A defect in the construct of bone between the superior and
inferior facets with varying degrees of displacement so the
vertebra with the defect and the spine above that vertebra are
displaced forward in relationship to the vertebrae below. It is
usually due to a developmental defect or the result of a fracture.
Displacement of one vertebra over another with fracture of a
posterior portion of the vertebra. A defect in the neural arch
between the superior and inferior facets of vertebrae without
separation at the defect and therefore no displacement of the
vertebrae. It may be unilateral or bilateral and is usually due toa
developmental defect but may be secondary to a fracture.
Situated above or directed upward toward the head of an
individual.

The fibrous band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. It is
mainly composed of collagen.

The chest level region of the spine that is located between the
