Six Different tastes : (1) Sweet, (2) Sour, (3) Salty, (4) Bitter, (5) Pungent,
(6) Astringent these six tastes have been considered.

Based on the actions of previous births, the body obtained in this birth, the food
that is taken in this birth and the tastes involved in those foods are extremely essential
in the upkeep of this life's body. Hence, the energy is produced through the daily intake
of food and this very energy ensures the proper maintainance of the body. The energy
system obtained indirectly at the time of birth, which we have termed the Atma, can
correctly be called as based on the energy obtained from food.
