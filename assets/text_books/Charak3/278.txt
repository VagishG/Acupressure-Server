Thalamus (aaa ) : The portion in front of cerebellum, and below the
cerebrum (3Ã©q RAS) is called Thalamus. Its function is to transmit impulses
to the desired locations. Simple learning process is done by Thalamus.
Hypothalamus : This is again divided into two parts :
a) Posterior and Lateral Part
b) Anterior and Central Part
The posterior and lateral parts give complete support to the sympathetic
nerves' functions; whereas the anterior and central part of hypothalamus
serves the parasympathetic nerves' functions. In addition, it sends the
nerve fibres towards the medulla oblongata & assists in the breathing
functions, in the regulation & control of body temperature, in balancing
fat, carbohydrate & water in the digestive action and also is the main
centre in the working of emotional behaviours; it is also connected to
the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus also assists with the help of pituitary
in the functioning of all the endocrine glands.
Olfactory Bulbs : This is located just above the nose. Due to the development
of human beings, its place has been taken by cerebrum. Ina more developed
person, it has greater relevance.
Basal Ganglia :
It has two parts :
a) Striped part;
b) Non-Striped part.
The striped part is called corpus striatum. This part controls body postures
and position and ensures a balanced human behaviour.
