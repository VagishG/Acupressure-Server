Cerebral Hemisphere : This is the main part of the central nervous system.

Its upper portion is dome-shaped and the lower portion is flat. Major part of

the skull cavity is occupied by the cerebral hemispheres. It has the following

main parts :

a) cerebral cortex : This is the upper part of the brain and is filled with
grey matter;

b) __ the white nerve fibres are in the lower part of the cerebral and are
called white matter;

c) between the above two parts is the concentration of nerve fibres called

corpus collosum.

a) Cerebral Cortex :

Complex mental activities originate from the cerebral cortex. It is the upper part
of the brain and looks like the creases of wall nut. Looking superficialy, its surface
appears depressed and some surface protruding. The depressed part is called sulcus

or fissure (3ft@N), the portion between two depressed part is called gyrus (#1)
and the protruding parts are called Ridges (48), Creeks of cortex divide it into two
parts and the longer creek is called Rolando or Central Fissure. The other creek is
called Fissure of Sylvious. Valley of creases are more at some places and less at
others. The depth of fissures varies at different places. Cerebral cortex is divided
into four parts by deep fissures :

1)
2)
3)
4)

frontal lobe (34 GS) : The front portion is called frontal lobe;
parietal lobe (tiffaa Ge/eITe GS) : This is at the back on the upper side;
occipital lobe (7X4HIT GS) : This is behind the parietal lobe;

temporal lobe (3@ GE) : This is below the parietal lobe in the front.

Different lobes perform different activities. The activity of vision is performed
by the occipital lobe, touch by parietal, speech by frontal & hearing activity is performed
by the temporal lobe.
