Motor Function (dra/aferar√©t fran) :

The operation and control of motor function in a person is by the front-thin-
long part of Rolando Fissures. In this part, pyramid like cells are found. The
control of muscle movements of all parts of the body is by this motor
region. Any problem in the motor region of brain's right hemisphere causes
deterioration in operation and control of voluntary actions in the left part of the
body. Similarly the left hemisphere of brain affects right part of the body. It is
due to the motor regions, that a person's desire get converted into action. When
a person desires to walk, the motor centre forces the motor nerves corresponding
to walking, for contraction & flexibility, resulting in the legs moving forward &
the person starts walking.

Associated Functions ( aeeet farart ) :

The function of cerebrum is not only to receive the afferent impulses or to
generate motor impulses but also to coordinate the nerve impulses and sending
them to the proper places. Due to this coordination between different nerve
impulses, a person's thinking, learning, reasoning etc. & other mental activities
are performed.

From the above description, it is clear that particular parts of brain perform &
control specific function like understanding after reading is by visual association
area (#8 wead 8), meaningful speech & writing is by motor association
area (Xt Brea HTT), thinking reasoning activities etc. are by front association
area (3 Uea4 AW). In some activities, brain's particular part is found to be
extra active. If that part is damaged, then the corresponding activity is not
permanently impaired; such activities can be redeveloped but only partially. In
cerebrum, apart from the above centres, there are some more centres for other
activities.

Brain centres which are injured or damaged are diagnosed by the corresponding
patient's activity which gets affected.
