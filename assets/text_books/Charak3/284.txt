Medulla Oblongata ( Gy=t vit) :

The upper part of the spinal cord is called medulla oblongata. This is 2.7
cm long on an average. It is a very important component of the central
nerval fibres (@-4t4 differ aq). Its shape is cylindrical while the upper
part is blown a little. Below the pons and above the spinal cord, the part
which is on the floor of skull cavity. (@c-¥g1) is called medulla oblongata.
In this, grey matter is inside and white matter is outside. This connects
spinal cord and that part of brain which is above medulla oblongata.
Simultaneously, it provides a passage to go inside the brain. This nerve
connects with the other important nerves of the brain. All life saving
activities are operated and controlled by medulla oblongata. Its own
control is by respiration & cardiac.

Cerebellum ( atqafees ) :

This is smaller than cerebrum and is situated at its back & lower part. It
is divided into two hemispheres joined in the middle. At its floor, at
equal intervals, are long fissures & ridges (aeftam@). These fissures are
rather deep. Cerebellum is one tenth of the total weight of the brain. On
one side its nerve fibres are connected to the medulla oblongata and on
the other side it is connected to the brain through the pons. Its outer part
is grey matter, internal part is of white matter. Some portion of the outer
grey matter go inside the inner white matter in such a way that if the
cerebellum is dissected, it looks like a tree. Cerebellum is connected
with fibres to the cerebrum. Three bunches are protruded & called
Superior Penduncle, Middle Penduncle & Inferior Penduncle which
respectively are connected to mid-brain, pons and medulla oblongata.
The muscular efforts are balanced and controlled by cerebellum. Due to it,
the body's posture is steady and ensures that the body does not get
imbalanced. Muscles which generate movement are controlled by
cerebellum.
