Brief Notes on Nervous System

1. It detects & responds to changes, inside & outside the body.
2. — Classfication of :

NS.

Central N.S. Peripheral N.S.

i, -,

Brain Spinal cord — Cranial Spinal

3. The smallest functional unit of N.S. is called as Nerve cell orNeuron.
Food for Nerve cells / N.S. is only "glucose".
Nerve cells produce & transmit nerve impulses or electrical charges.
"Inritability"
Transmission = "Conductivity"
6. Speed of conduction of Nerve Impulse

Production

> in nerves with larger diameter increases.
> in myelinated (sheathed) nerves increases.
7. Range of Impulse conduction = 0.5m/sec to 130m/sec.

8. Brain tissue = "Neuralgia" which makes 4" to % of brain tissue. It
is non-excitable & replicates throughout life (unlike nerve cells).

e Acts as supporting tissue of C.N.S.
e Acts as Blood-Brain Barrier.
(Prevents toxins exchange between Blood & Brain).
9. The C.N.S. (Brain & Spinal cord) is protected by three membranes/ meninges.
10. The most important section of NS. is that Brain has 4 ventricles (cavity).
e From their wall is secreted CSF (cerebro spinal fluid) through blood vessls.
e This fluid surrounds & protects the Brain & the spinal cord.
