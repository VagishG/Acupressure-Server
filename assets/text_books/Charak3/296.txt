The Human Spine

Back is the Musculo-skeletal support axis.
It - supports body weight
- transmits forces through pelvis to lower limbs.
- carry & position the head.
- brace & help maneuver upper limbs.
The vertebral column has two curvatures -
e primary (retaining embryostate) in thoracic & sacral
@ secondary (curved inwards) in cervical & lumber regions.

As stress on the back appears, more load is felt in cervical & lumbar regions. Hence-
Cervical & Lumbar problems are more common.
