the aforesaid principle. So on this basis this micro/macro principle can be reproduced
for cosmos and Body. Body's main organs like Heart, Brain, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys,
Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine, Small Intestine, Gall Bladder, Urinary Bladder etc.
are micro in relation to the body and being a component of the body, only proves the
macro-micro principle. All in all, this cosmos is infinite, eternal and so this body is
also infinite. Ata macro level, main organs can be 10 but at a micro level each body has
infinite organs and each organ again have infinite sub-organs and each one has infinite
cells. Hence Ayurveda is endless. From this clarification, it is clear that Ayurvedic
Acupressure is a therapy for treatment of infinite diseases whose classification based
on 10-origin principle to 10 can ensure a process for treatment of infinite diseases.
