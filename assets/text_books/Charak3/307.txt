Before starting treatment, it is essential to know that diagnosis and nature of
the disease.

For diagnosis, tables given in Charak-I Ayurvedic Acupressure book should
be used.

For diagnosis, ‘visible’ symptoms described in this book should be kept in
mind.

Different diagnostic physiological reports like blood, urine, stool tests,
ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, X-ray, Ecodoppler tests reports, as available should
be seen and kept in mind.

In Acupuncture the eight guiding principles should be kept in mind.

For ordinary therapists and for the public, multiple protocols of a single
disease have been given basing on various tests like MRI, U/s, CT scan etc.
Using these protocols, even serious diseases can be treated easily.

For selection of meridian, diagram of all types of meridians have been given
at the end of this book. Also, principle for selecting a meridian have been
indicated at various places in Charak Ayurvedic Acupressure Part-II. Selection
should be done on the basis of facts. Based on use and experience, gradually
specialisation can be achieved.

By pressing, at the location of meridians, i.e., at the wrists and by only twisting
of the fingers and toes, ordinary treatment can be done; the painful fingers
and joints should be a basis for treatment.

After selecting a meridian, it is imperative to assess the energies related to
the ten elements. For selecting and then preparing the network of energy,
analysis of disease, element's function, attribute, integration, common and
specifics, protocols have been prepared which have proved very effective for
both and common and specialist therapists. By their persistent experience
use training and study, a therapist can attain specialisation and himself/herself
prepare protocols for new diseases.
