Increase or Decrease in the symptoms - the patient feels it.
Uneasiness

The patient may feel uneasy and he/she may even say so that he/she is
not feeling well

Summarising, if by tonification of a meridian, the patient feels
heaviness in the head/eyes or increase in anyother symptom, it
indicates that there already was excess energy there; and vice versa of
by sedation the above mentioned feelings appear. We can thus, judge
on which meridian there is excess or reduced energy.

Latest Method of Inference -

Please refer to the figure on page 89, where male,
female finger magnets are shown. If it is a male therapist, then
use only RT index and middle finger to take out inference. For
example, to check energy on a patients left thumb OVM -

point 4, put your RT IF on this point (30 sec) then RT MF on
this point (30 Sec.). Feel the pulse / throbbing / beating in
finger tip. If pulse is felt on Rt If=N (Male), then sedate that
point & on Rt MF =S (Males), then tone that point. Similarly,
if therapist is female, the finger polarity is opposite & then - if
pulse is felt on Rt IF = S (Female), sedate that point, and on Rt
MF=N (Female), tone that point.
