of bones is due to deficiency of calcium or due to accidents. Such patients are given
pain killers and calcium medicines. From this view, sedation of wind (2) and impulse
of nerves (6), pain can be controlled. So both these points have to be sedated; for
increasing calcium, main components water (4), phosphorus (3) and calcium (5) are to
be tonified. For bringing the broken bone to its original position, Disha (7) is to be
corrected & its energy is to be tonified. So the following protocol is to be used incase
ofa fracture.
