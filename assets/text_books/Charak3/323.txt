2) Spinal Nerves related treatment :

Treatment protocols for spine's 30 vertebrae have already been given earlier.
Normally, the ailments in vertebrae are of a limited type but nerves related diseases
have a wide range. Based on physiology and anatomy, 31 pairs of nerves take off from
the spinal vertebrae. Each nerve has two parts :

1) Anterior Branch
2) Posterior Branch

Spinal Nerves in 31 Pairs :

1) Cervical 8
2) Thoracic 12
3) Lumbar 5
4) Sacral 5
5) Coccygeal 1

The above named 31 pairs of treatment meridians have been identified in the figures
in two ways : Every nerve that comes out of the spine is a unit in itself; by division left
& right they have two parts and each nerve again has two parts and they are ventral and
dorsal. So for the right part, starting from right palm's wrist to left palm's wrist, the 31
pair meridians have been identified for the right side of spinal cord.

For the meridians of 31 pairs of spinal cord's nerves on the left side are shown in
the sketch below.
