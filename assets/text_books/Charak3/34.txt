Slip Dise :

When Lumbar-sacral area's & cervical area's disc slips from its position, it is
termed as slip disc. Some stress & strain also causes slip disc & it is called Disc
Protrusion. Due to slip disc, the nerve that comes out of the respective opening in the
spinal cord gets pressed and this causes unbearable pain in that nerve related
arm/leg; so much so that even strong pain killer medicines also do not give any relief.
Slip Disc can happen due to several causes. Wrong posture, slipping & falling and trauma
can cause slip disc. Normal protrusion can happen due to osteophytes in some spinal
vertebra and surgery is generally advised. But Acupressure has provided cure in several
cases and surgery has been avoided. Such patients have however to be treated for long
periods.
