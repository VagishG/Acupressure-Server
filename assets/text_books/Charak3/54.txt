1) Scoliosis :
Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral curvature of the vertebral column. A true scoliosis

involves not only the (right or left sided) curvature but also a rotational element of the
vertebra upon another.

a) Congenital (since birth) scoliosis is usually associated with abnormalities
of the chest wall, gene to urinary tract & heart disease.

b) In children with cerebral paralysis or polio, scoliosis is seen as central or
peripheral nerve abnormalities (neuropathic scoliosis).

c) When muscle is abnormal, it is not in alignment with the vertebral column &
hence curvature develops. This is rare case as muscular dystrophy.

Other disorders that can produce scoliosis include bone tumors, spinal cord tumors
& bralized disc protrusions.

Generally, there is no precise knowledge of the causes but specifically spinal
column is made of bone tissue.Hence, when bone factors are affected, the shape of the
spinal column is affected and its curvature becomes disaligned which we see as scoliosis.
When the lateral part is inclined, nerve fibres are also stretched and this stretching
continuously remains and is the cause of constant pain in the back and various parts of
legs. Due to the related nerve fibre symptom of pain appear in the back and various
parts of the legs and this ailment normally is considered incurable. As specific treatment,
from point of view of attribute, function, common, specific, integration of elements
of Ayurveda, the treatment is simple and easy but due to the changes in the bone skeleton,
treatment is recommended to be prolonged. By learning it and continuing treatment,
control of pain and gradual normalisation of spine curvature is easy and natural.
