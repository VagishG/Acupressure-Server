Due to changes in different parts of the brain, general tension, headache, migrain,
uneasiness, paralysis, parkinson, cancer etc. is a long list of serious diseases. Severe
and uncontrollable toothache can also bring instant relief by pressing on the ten eye
orbit points. Similarily, for left or right side migrain, point on the eye orbit at which
the patient feels severest pain can be pressed and immediate relief obtained. But by
observing the nature & severity of migrain, treatment by using magnets on the meridian
related to the most painful eye orbit point is found to be more helpful.

As mentioned earlier, correspondence between the cosmos and human body, i.e.,
from macro to micro is available all the time. This comparison is adopted time &
again. In acupressure, the whole body has been represented on the palms of the hand
and soles of the feet; again at a further micro level, the whole body can be represented
oneach finger. Similarly, palm's fist form corresponds to a brain's hemisphere and the
two fists appear to correspond to the entire brain. From Ayurvedic Acupressure and
Human Physiology’s joint of view, brain's both hemispheres and each of their subparts’
four lobes each can be identified on each finger of both hands. General and specific
treatment can esaily be done. The three phalanx of every finger representing Vatta,
Pitta & Kapha i.e., of each sub part of lobe's upper, middle & lower part and the treatment
is then feasible & found effective.
