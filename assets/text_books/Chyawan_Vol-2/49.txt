10. other treatment Protocols of Haemorrhage

Individuals in excellent physical and cardiovascular shape may have

more effective compensatory mechanisms before experiencing
cardiovascular collapse. These patients may look deceptively stable,
with minimal derangements in vital signs, while having poor peripheral
perfusion. Elderly patients or those with chronic medical conditions may
have less tolerance to blood loss, less ability to compensate, and may
take medications such as betablockers that can potentially blunt the
cardiovascular response. Care must be taken in the assessment of
these patients.
