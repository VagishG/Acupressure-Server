system of human body, has been further simplified for
better understanding and is renamed as the Tulyarthta
concept. The phenomenon of “alikeness” has been put
forward here as we see in the practical world that the face
and features of a child resembles to that of its parents;
similarly our palms and soles resemble that of our body
structure.

If we closely observe our palms and soles, we find a
central broad part representing the trunk and the five
fingers are alike to the five projections of the body. It
appears so that the palm and soles have been ‘born out’ of
the human body, just like a child originates from parents.
In these two forms of creations, the contribution of Lord
Brahma is clearly visible. Let us now discuss as how to
use these smaller units of palms and soles and identify
acu-point on them.
