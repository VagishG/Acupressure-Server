This is a very simple mode of treatment through
acupressure. Through the above diagramatic
representations, any person can know the activities
going on within oneself; can access the energy changes
and treat oneself to obtain good health. The most
astonishing and unique feature of these acu points is that
if there is pain, it is indicative ofa disease else if no pain -
no disease. Thus, through one acu point only, the trio of
diagnosis, treatment and health is possible.

Techniques of Accupressure Treatment :

1. By Pressure : This process is known as
Acupressure. If there is pain on pressing any point,
then it indicates the disease related to the part of the
body. Hence pressure is applied as a stimulus on the
acu-point for about one minute for 2 to 3 times a day
by a blunt instrument as Jimmi and Probe as shown
below:

The amount of pressure is based upon the tolerance
of the patient. After regularly pressing for a few
days, ifthe amount of pain reduces at that acu-point,
it indicates that the disease has also been reduced.
