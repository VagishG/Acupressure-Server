morning as the sun rises & we go to bed when it starts
turning dark. This day & night phenomenon of nature
brought about by the rotational relationships between the
heavenly bodies, gives the clue to the energy changes in
our body. If the sun rises late or we get up late in the
mornings, our cosmic energies as well as human body
energy status both are affected. Hence, this energy level
concept of Acupressure therapy also teaches about how
to live & lead a healthy life. By knowing in depth the way
the energy travels, how much quantity & quality of
energy exists, where it goes & what it does in human
body can tell us the course of our daily routine; when to
get up, to sleep, to work, to eat, to relax, etc. etc.; daily
chores can be energetically carried on in a healthy
manner. This shall result in a healthy life pattern; the
phenomenon ofa balanced body, mind, soul & spirit will
be established. This is the aim & role of this Acupressure
healing method.
