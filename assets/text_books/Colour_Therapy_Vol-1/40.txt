in the morning and evening is a healthy sign. The
stool should be golden brown in colour, in a solid
state and without any smell/odour; which indicates
that the meals have been properly digested.

The excretion of urine should be approx. 5-6 times
ina whole day. Going for urination just after meal is
a preventive measure for stones and such kind of
disorders. The colour of urine should be light
yellow; it should be in free flow with no
obstructions and no smell; these are indications of
good health. Going for urination at night (inbetween
sleep period) is indicative of illness, As per the
normal frequency, if there is excessive or less
urination, it is also indicative of disease process.

A daily sleep of 6-8 hrs. in an uninterrupted manner
is a sign of good health. If the sleep is sound with no
dreams and one feels fresh in the morning, it
indicates a healthy sleeping pattern. The appropriate
time of going to bed is around 9-10 p.m. and of
waking up is between 4-5 a.m. for kids, the duration
