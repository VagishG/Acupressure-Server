Thus, it can be said that Acupressure works on the
concept of energy. The place where pressure is applied
on the living body is called the acu point or needle like

have various inter connections to each other as well as to
the various segments of the body. They work under a
certian network of energy called meridian system, which
directs & transfers the stimulated energy-changes from
one place to another, creating healing effects.

with the energy system of human body, we come to know
