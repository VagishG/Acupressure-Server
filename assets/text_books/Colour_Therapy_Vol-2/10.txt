Another example of use of colour is being cited from
Indian social structure where married women use the red
colour circular mark (Bindi) between eye brows on the
forehead to tone up the circulation and hormonal
function of pituitary gland which controls the function of
all endocrine glands. Contrary to it widows use white
sandal paste to control sexual feelings. In this manner the
body management by way using colour was possible.
Today uncontrolled and rapid upsurge of disease process
again revived old values adopted by our ancients in the
form of acupressure and acupuncture. These modes of
naturopathy such as this or various modes of acupressure
of being proved very result oriented, cost effective, self
employment oriented. This can reduce the health budget
of families and as a whole budget of the country. Today
under developed and developing countries suffer
demographic pressure as such alternate medicines where
no use of chemicals orally or injected is without side
effects also. Today all are suffering by virtue of external
and internal pollutions. In view of this prospect Sir Park
Jae Woo, an ancient scientist and philosopher of South
Korea has mentioned the use of colours in onnuri
medicine (whole body Sujok treatment). Due to his early
demise from the physical world, this work has been
undertaken by research cell of ASPEUS by the grace of
God.
