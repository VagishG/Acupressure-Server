mornings, our cosmic energies as well as human body
energy status both are affected. Hence, this energy level
concept of Acupressure therapy also teaches about how
to live & lead a healthy life. By knowing in depth the way
the energy travels, how much quantity & quality of
energy exists, where it goes & what it does in human
body can tell us the course of our daily routine; when to
get up, to sleep, to work, to eat, to relax, etc. etc.; daily
chores can be energetically carried on in a healthy
manner. This shall result in a healthy life pattern; the
phenomenon ofa balanced body, mind, soul & spirit will
be established. This is the aim & role of this Acupressure
healing method.
