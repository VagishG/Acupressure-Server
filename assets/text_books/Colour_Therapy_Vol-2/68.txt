place where it is applied. This slight change in the energy
level, at any place or point in human body thereby affects
the whole body in totality. Hence it is also known as a
Holistic Method of treatment.

How Acupressure treats? To know this phenomenon,
we have to first understand the energy system of human
body. As discussed earlier, the human body is a
component of this cosmos. Now let us raise a question, as
to who made this entire cosmos — the mountains, rivers,
plants & trees, the planets & satellites, the sun & the
moon etc.? The scientists are still proving many facts
although it is evident and yet unknown to them — one
very practical fact as, can they know the depth of all
sciences as palmistry, astronomy, numerology,
archeology etc. etc. & prove their true existence ? One
believes in palmistry or not for example is just not the
question here. But rather the thing to be considered is that
is palmistry also a science? Until & unless we have the
in-depth knowledge of a field, we have no right to say
"Palmistry is all rubbish" as we are ignorant of it.
Similarly we the scientific & so called modern world
speaks proudly & disbelieve the esoteric sciences like
Pranic healing, Reiki etc. They are dealing with the
actual energy system of the body. As there is a digestive
system, a respiratory system in our body, so there is an
energy system in our body.
