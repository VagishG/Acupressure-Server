pressure on channels for 1-2 minutes, twice a day.
Such mild stimulations on specific points, fingers
& zones of palms & soles thus creates a balanced
energy status releiving one from acute to chronic
ailments.

The most amazing and interesting fact about
this Acupressure science is that if we just try to
check ourselves on a daily basis, we find some
points on palms & soles highly painful. We feel
astonished as we felt so healthy & still why this
pain is here! This daily "free medical check up"
thereby tells us about our day to day ailments &
relieves/cures them, then & there. If we neglect
this phenomenon, we never know when & how a
disease process sets in & turns into a gall stone, a
tumor or an ulcer ! Hence Acupressure thus alerts
towards a daily routine massage of one's human
body through palms & soles, to make & keep the
live bio-energy in full bloom.
