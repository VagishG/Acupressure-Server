CHAPTER-2
CONSTIPATION (AN INTRODUCTION)

Constipation, the root of several
psychosomatic disorders has become so common,
specially in the civilized and advanced countries
that a medical historian can justifiably describe the
present period as "the Era of Constipation". Other
developing and underdeveloped countries are
gradually progressing in that direction. The growing
intake of artificial foods, increasing mental tension,
lack of rest and a careless attitude towards
responding to the natural urges are primarily
responsible for this tragedy and these habits have
become inseparable parts of the civilized society.
Unfortunately, medical scientists are paying less
attention to this problem; and often tend to dismiss
its significance looking upon it as a purely local
phenomenon confined to the colon or large
intestine thereby exhibiting ignorance about its
systemic effects on the remaining parts of the body.
Similarly, piles, which is primarily an outcome of
chronic constipation, is erroneously considered as
an ailment confined to the walls of the anus and the
fact that it is only a sign of a systemic disorder, is
totally ignored.
