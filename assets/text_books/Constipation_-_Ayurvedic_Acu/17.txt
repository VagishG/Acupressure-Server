harmless drugs, vegetables and foods in order to
restore the balance. These should both cure and
prevent constipation and should not become
addictive. They should not cause, directly or
indirectly any adverse effect on the gastro intestinal
tract. On the other hand, they should produce
beneficial effects on the body. These medicines
should simultaneously correct the functioning of
the liver and work towards the prevention as well
as cure of piles.

Related disease with constipation is not only
the movement of the faeces, it is the indicator of
day to day well being of the body. As we know blood
is the energy carrier and it is produced in the G.I.T.
Thus the formation of the blood and excretion of
urine & stool is indicator of the balanced energy
in the body. Blood is produce by the combined
activity of teeth, oesophagus, stomach, duodenum,
small intestine, pancreas, gall bladder, liver, colon
& urinary bladder. Therefore constipation is not
ordinary phenomenon & it is not an ordinary
disease. Constipation is from acute to chronic &
responsible for acute, chronic & dreaded diseases.
