meridian system. It proves the energy flow-and it
can be preceived as vessel and these meridians may
be preceived as very micro fibers covering whole
of the body. Such meridians start from head & pass
through sensory organs/segments of brain, throat,
chest & abdomen & upto extremities. Meaning
there by the disease of G.I.T. (Gastrointestinal
Tract) may be connected to throat, sense organ &
brain segment & the extremitis. Therefore
constipation means stagnation of urine, stool &
also constipation of ideas resulting into acute to
chronic depression and it may be a causative factor
of ears, nose, eyes disorders etc. This is beyond
the thinking of common man. It is responsible also
for cervical & spine disorders. Therefore
constipation is not alone constipation but it is a
number of symptoms of disease appearing here &
there in the body. Therefore in this small book wide
range of diseases have been covered. For the sake
of simplicity, treatment is given on fingers and toes
of the palms/soles. One has to choose the affected
finger/toe by twisting and apply seeds/magnets for
effective treatment.
