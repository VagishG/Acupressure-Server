stimulation of the receptors in the rectal mucosa.
Normally, the rectum remains empty. Because of

intestines) the fecal matter moves from the colon
to the rectum. This causes distension in the rectum
and because of reflex action, the individual desires
to pass the stool. As a result of this, the internal
sphincter in the anus opens. Because of the reflex
action and pressure of the abdominal muscles
which are generally exercized during the process
of defecation, the external sphincter also opens
resulting in the passage of the stool. If a person
voluntarily suppresses this urge, then defecation
does not take place until a few hours later when
persistaltic movement takes place again. If such
urges for defecation are suppressed or inhibited
repeatedly it can lead to constipation.

and the colon. The water content of the stool which
