is responsible for its soft consistency gets
absorbed into the blood stream. This makes the
stool hard preventing it from moving down easily,
and when it moves, it causes irritation in the wall
including the local vessels of the anus and its
opening. This gives rise to piles and anal fissures
(tearing or causing small ulcers in the opening of
the anus). In their turn, these ulcers, because of the
associated inflammation and pain, prevent the
proper opening of the sphincters which leads again
to further constipation. This vicious circle
continues till the patient gets local and systemic
signs of indisposition and needs to consult a doctor
for his treatment.

Feces : Feces are derived partly from the
ingested food but mainly from the metabolic
byproducts in the blood secreted through the colon
wall. They contain about 65 per cent water and 35
per cent of solids. Much of the cellulose contents
of the food ingredients which are not amenable to
the actions of digestive enzymes secreted from
salivary glands in the mouth, small glands in the
stomach, liver, pancreas and small intestine, pass
out unchanged. Metabolic byproducts contribute
