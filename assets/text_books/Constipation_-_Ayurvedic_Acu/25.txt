people saying — the soul has departed from the body
& therefore it is dead. This so called soul or Atma
or Energy we repeat here which makes a human
being living, is the actual source of all energy
systems within the body. This life force enters the
womb of a mother & is born out as a child by the
extra ordinary & supernatural phenomenon of
nature. The sperm & the ova of a male & female
respectively may unite many a times but the life
force is introduced only at a specific moment as &
when destined by the creator of this soul. Thereby
we can say that the 'Param- atma' introduces its
smaller segment ‘atma' in a mother's womb, to
given birth to an entirely new kind of energy system.
So does Acupressure. It helps in healing the
illnesses by a slight pressure on human body &
thereby stimulating the energy level connected to
the soul of the living person. Putting any pressure
on a dead human body makes no effect due to lack
of this energy system although the dead body has
digestive, circulatory, respiratory organs. The
functioning is absent because the energy or soul
has disappeared.
