constipation. The gas also dries up the water content
of the stool and makes it hard. This causes difficulty
in evacuation. The friction it causes in the wall of
the anus results in piles and anal fissures (tearing
or small ulcers). Apart from wrong food, mental
tension and anxiety contribute to the formation of
gas in large quantities leading to constipation.

Piles : The end part (about 1") of the colon is
called the anus. Its mucous lining is arranged in
numerous vertical folds and each fold contains an
artery and a vein. Through these veins the impure
blood of this region is drained to the heart through
the liver. If there is any obstruction to the back flow
of this blood from the anal region or if there is
excessive friction in the walls of these veins
because of hard stool then they get swollen. If more
pressure is exerted on these swollen veins, then
