intestines. If the colon is distended with feces, then
this back-flow is prevented. If the liver is congested

causes friction and injury to the walls of these veins.
Sometimes undue abdominal pressure is exerted
by a constipated patient to move the bowels which
causes strain in these veins. Thus, constipation is
an important factor both directly and indirectly in
causing piles.

There are, of course, other factors such as a
tumour obstructing the veins or the pressure
exerted by the womb of a pregnant woman. Piles
