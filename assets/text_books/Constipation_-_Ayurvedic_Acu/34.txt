slimy fluid. This condition is generally

associated with nausea, gripping pain,

heaviness in the abdomen, vomiting and
repeated desire to pass stool which is then
voided with pain.

Types of Constipation : Ayurveda recognizes
three states of the colon; mild, medium and hard,
according to our constitutional condition, as Pitta
(fire), Kapha (water) or Vata (air).

Those with mild state of the colon, tend to
loose or oily stool. If they become constipated,
any mild laxative, such as warm milk, will usually
be sufficient. Constipation will not often become
chronic. This is more characteristic of Pitta
constitution as Pitta tends towards oiliness.

Medium state of the colon characterizes
Kapha. Stronger laxatives may be needed for more
long-term usage.

Hard or difficult state of the colon
characterizes Vata. Strong laxatives may be
necessary short-term, and constipation is often
chronic and difficult to remedy.

Hence, constipation is usually a Vata (air)
disorder, particularly as a long-standing condition
