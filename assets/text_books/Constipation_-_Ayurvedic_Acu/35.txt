Vata (Air) Constipation : As the main site
for Vata is the large intestine, high Vata is
characterized by dryness in the colon, the
accumulation of intestinal gas, with abdominal
distention and constipation. The tongue usually
has an accumulation of brownish fur at the
back. There may be bad breath or the passing
of gas, along with pain, tenesmus and anxiety.
Headache may occur.

Causes are wrong diet with too much dry or
light food, taking of drugs (most drugs have a
diuretic or drying effect that aggravates Vata),
smoking, excessive thinking, worrying, fear and
anxiety, overstimulation of the nervous
system, and old age. Constipation can cause,
or be involved in, many Vata (wind) disorders
including arthritis, neurosis, epilepsy and
paralysis. Therefore, treating constipation can
be a root treatment for many nervous system
disorders.
