ii) Pitta (Fire) Type : Pitta constipation often
occurs during the course or towards the end
of a febrile disease. In Ayurveda, purgatives
are contraindicated in new fevers but
prescribed in old fevers. They are often given
after the fever is gone to clear out residual
heat and toxins. In Chinese medicine,
purgatives are often given during high fevers,
as another method of draining the fever, but
care is taken that the fever is 'ripe' . Indications
of a ripe, or firm, fever are constipation,
distention, gas and strong abdominal pain.

Pitta constipation involves irritability, anger,
thirst, sweating with body odour and burning
sensation. It is characterized by a red tongue
with yellow coating. The breath will be
unpleasant. The face may be flushed or red.
There may be headache, or insomnia with
violent dreams.

Causes are those which increase Pitta,
including too much spicy, sour or salty food,
too much meat or greasy food. In constipation
the hot attribute of Pitta is aggravated. Hence,
hot spices, overexposure to the sun or heat,
inadequate intake of fluids, etc. will by strong
aggravating factors. Pitta type constipation
