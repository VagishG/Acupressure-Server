of the body cells. An essential nutrient is a
substance that cannot be made by the body and must
therefore be included in the diet.

A balanced diet contains all nutrients required
for health in appropriate proportions, and is
normally achieved by eating a variety of food. If
any nutrient is eaten in excess or is deficient, health
may be adversely affected. For example, a calorie-
rich diet can lead to obesity, and an iron-deficient
one to anaemia. Ensuring a balanced diet
requires a certain amount of knowledge and
planning. Re-commendations for daily food intake,
sort foods of similar origins and nutritive values
into food groups, and advise that a certain number
of servings from each group be eaten daily. If this
plan is followed, the resulting dietary intake is
likely to be well balanced.

The five main food groups are :

e Bread, rice, cereal and pasta
Fruit and vegetables
Meat and fish
Dairy products, e.g. milk and cheese
Fats, oils and sweets.
