CHAPTER-4
CONSTIPATION & ITS
TREATMENT

About Constipation : Constipation is not disease;
it is a measure of the function of intestines and
body. How stool generates? Small intestine
transfers the unabsorbed fluid to large intestine;
there it resides for 10 to 12 hours. Here few ions
and water is absorbed as per requirement of the
body and these unwanted elements are transformed
into vitamins by bacteria residing in large intestine,
rest unwanted substance is transferred to sigmoid
colon with mucous. Here this substance is mixed
with mucous and transferred to rectum. Under
healthy condition this semi-solid waste is excreted
daily.

If mucous is not mixed properly in this waste
or water is absorbed more than required or absence
of defecation reflex, it all gives rise to constipation.

Constipation usually depends on diet, body
labour and mental conditions. Besides this seasonal
changes, malfunctioning of organs, are responsible
too. Treatment should be given under proper
diagnosis.
