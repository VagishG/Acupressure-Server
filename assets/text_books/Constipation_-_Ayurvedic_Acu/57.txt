This acupressure science also teaches us to
lead a healthy life in the manner the energy system
of the body works, For instance, we all know that
we get up in the morning as the sun rises & we go
to bed when it starts turning dark. This day & night
phenomenon of nature brought about by the
rotational relationships between the heavenly
bodies, gives the clue to the energy changes in our
body. If the sun rises late or we get up late in the
mornings, our cosmic energies as well as human
body energy status both are affected. Hence, this
energy level concept of Acupressure therapy also
teaches about how to live & lead a healthy life. By
knowing in depth the way the energy travels, how
much quantity & quality of energy exists, where it
goes & what it does in human body can tell us the
course of our daily routine; when to get up, to sleep,
to work, to eat, to relax, etc. etc.; daily chores can
be energetically carried on in a healthy manner.
This shall result in a healthy life pattern; the
phenomenon of a balanced body, mind, soul & spirit
will be established. This is the aim & role of this
Acupressure healing method.
