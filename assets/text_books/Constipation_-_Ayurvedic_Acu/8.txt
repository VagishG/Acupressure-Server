Thus, acupressure treatment of head & neck
ailments can be easily carried out by using our own
thumbs or big toes. A small amount of pressure
can thereby relieve simple to chronic problems of
this segment of body. Regarding our arms & legs,
they are the longer projections of our body & hence
are treated on the four long fingers/toes of palms
& soles respectively. As discussed above, the
methods of twist, ring masage or methi strip can
similarly be used on these fingers & toes
corresponding to arms & legs.

For example for leg problems like pain in hip
joints, knees or ankle joints, for leg swellings, sole
cracks or numbness, cramps, weakness and, or
trembling in legs etc. treatment by massaging on
the middle & ring fingers/toes, longer fingers,
corresponding to the two legs is highly
effective. The three joints of these fingers
correspond to the three leg joints & are treated by
using methi strips, ring massage or a simple twist
applied to the whole finger and/or the affected/
painful joint. Similarly for the pains and aches of
arms, shoulder stiffness, elbow sprains, wrist joint
swellings, arm weakness and/or numbness, tremors
