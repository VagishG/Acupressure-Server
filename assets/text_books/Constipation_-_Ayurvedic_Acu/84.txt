In the body the entry of infections is mainly
from food and water due to which they get infected.
The second gate of entry of infection is the nose
door from which first the lungs and then the blood
gets infected and this leads to breathing disorders
and skin diseases. The infections enter in the body
from food pipe and wind pipe, spreads in every cell
of body and the body's immunity is affected.
According to ayurveda, the minutely sized
microbes are similar to the subtler soul and are
highly injurious.

When the GIT is infected the related main
organs like stomach, small intestine and large
intestine are treated on these meridians as shown
below.
