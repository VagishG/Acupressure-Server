CHAPTER-5S
ABOUT LARGE INTESTINE

The Large Intestine : This is about 1.5
metres long, beginning at the caecum in the right
iliac fossa and terminating at the rectum and anal
canal deep in the pelvis. Its lumen is larger than
that of the small intestine. It forms an arch round
the coiled-up small intestine.

For descriptive purposes the colon is divided
into the caecum, ascending colon, transverse
dcolon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum
and anal canal.

The Caecum : This is the first part of the
colon. It is a dilated region which has a blind end
inferiorly and is continuous with the ascending
colon superiorly. Just below the junction of the
two, the ileocaecal valve opens from the ileum.
The vermiform appendix is a fine tube, closed at
one end, which leads from the caecum. It is usually
about 13 cm long and has the same structure as the
walls of the colon but contains more lymphoid
tissue.

The ascending colon : This passes upwards
from the caecum to the level of the liver where it
curves acutely to the left at the hepatic flexure to
become the transverse colon.
