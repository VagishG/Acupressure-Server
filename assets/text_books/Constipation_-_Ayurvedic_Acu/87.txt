The parts of the large intestine (colon) and their positions.

The Transverse Colon : This is a loop of
colon which extends across the abdominal cavity
in front of the duodenum and the stomach to the
area of the spleen where it forms the splenic
flexure and curves acutely downwards to become
the descending colon.

The Descending Colon : This passes down
the left side of the abdominal cavity then curves
towards the midline. After it enters the true pelvis
it is known as the sigmoid colon.

The Sigmoid Colon : This part describes an
S-shaped curve in the pelvis then continues
downwards to become the rectum.
