The Rectum : This is a slightly dilated section
of the colon about 13 cm long. It leads from the
sigmoid colon and terminates in the anal canal.

The Anal Canal : This is a short passage about
3.8 cm long in the adult and leads from the rectum
to the exterior. Two sphincter muscles control the
anus; the internal sphincter, consisting of smooth
muscle fibres, is under the control of the
autonomic nervous system and the external
sphincter, formed by skeletal muscle, is under
voluntary control.

Structure : The four layers of tissue described
in the basic structure of the gastrointestinal tract
are present in the colon, the rectum and the anal
canal. The arrangement of the longitudinal muscle
fibres is modified in the colon.
