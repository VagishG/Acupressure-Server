Arragement of muscle fibres, in the colon, rectum and anus.
Sections have been removed to show the layers

They do not form a smooth continuous layer
of tissue but are collected into three bands, called
taeniae coli, situated at regular intervals round the
colon. They stop at the junction of the sigmoid
colon and the rectum. As these hands of muscle
tissue are slightly shorter than the total length of
the colon they give a sacculated or puckered
appearance to the organ.

The longitudinal muscle fibres spread out as
in the basic structure and completely surround the
rectum and the anal canal. The anal sphincters are
formed by thickening of the circular muscle layer.
