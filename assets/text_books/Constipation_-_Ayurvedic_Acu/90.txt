Ayurvedic Correspondence (Treatment by
palms and soles) :

As we have learnt in the previous pages, the
miniature of the whole human body is manifested
on the palms & soles. Hence the Acupressure
treatment of various ailments can be very easily
carried out by slightest stimulations on specific
acu points on them. Considering a general massage
of the whole body, we use a wooden roller with
pointed surfaces to massage on these palms &
soles. Also another instrument called pyramid (a
flat wooden/plastic mat with pointed surface) can
be used for stimulating the points on palms & soles
to produce a general stimulus to the life force
residing in the body. To activate this bio energy/
soul within our physical body and keep it in good
health i.e. a co-ordinated body-mind-soul-sprit, we
need a daily stimulus. For this, a foot or hand roller
massage on soles & palms respectively for five
minutes, twice a day relieves a person of general
fatigue, tiredness, laziness, dullness, anxiety & day
to day restlessness. It should be done while sitting
