In the submucosal layer there is more
lymphoid tissue than in any other part of the
alimentary tract, providing non-specific defence
against invasion by resident and other microbes.

In the mucosal lining of the colon and the
upper region of the rectum are large numbers of
goblet cells forming simple tubular glands, which
secrete mucus. They are not present beyond the
junction between the rectum and the anus.

The lining membrane of the anus consists of
stratified squamous epithelium continuous with the
mucous membrane lining of the rectum above and
which merges with the skin beyond the external anal
sphincter. In the upper section of the anal canal the
mucous membrane is arranged in 6 to 10 vertical
folds, the anal columns. Each column contains a
terminal branch of the superior rectal artery and
vein.

Blood Supply : Arterial supply is mainly by
the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.

The superior mesenteric artery supplies the
caecum, ascending and most of the transverse colon.

The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the
remainder of the colon and the proximal part of
the rectum.
