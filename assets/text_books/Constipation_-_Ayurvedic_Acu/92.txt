The distal section of the rectum and the anus
are supplied by branches from the internal iliac
arteries.

Venous drainage is mainly by the superior and
inferior mesenteric veins which drain blood from
the parts supplied by arteries of the same names.
These veins join the splenic and gastric veins to form
the portal vein. Veins draining the distal part of the
rectum and the anus join the internal iliac veins.
Functions of the Lage Intestine, Rectum and
Anal Canal

Absorption : The contents of the ileum which
pass through the ileocaecal valve into the caecum
are fluid, even though some water has been
absorbed in the small intestine. In the large intestine
absorption of water continues until the familiar
semisolid consistency of faeces is achieved.
Minerals salts, vitamins and some drugs are also

intestine.

Microbial Activity : The large intestine is

which synthesise vitamin K and folic acid. They
