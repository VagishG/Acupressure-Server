include Escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes,
Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens
(welchii). These microbes are commensals in
humans. They may become pathogenic if
transferred to another part of the body, e.g.
Escherichia coli may cause cystitis if it gains
access to the urinary bladder.

Gases in the bowel consist of some of the
constituents of air, mainly nitrogen, swallowed
with food and drink and as a feature of some anxiety
states. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are
produced by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed
nutrients, especially carbohydrate. Gases pass out
of the bowel as flatus.

Large numbers of microbes are present in the
faeces.

Mass Movement : The large intestine does
not exhibit peristaltic movement as it is seen in
other part of the digestive tract. Only at fairly long
intervals (about twice an hour) does a wave of strong
peristalsis sweep along the transverse colon forcing
its contents into the descending and sigmoid
colons. This is known as mass movement and it is
often precipitated by the entry of food into the
