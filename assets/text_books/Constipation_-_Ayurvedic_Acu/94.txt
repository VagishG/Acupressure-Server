stomach. This combination of stimulus and
response is called the gastrocolic reflex.

Defaecation : usually the rectum is empty,
but when a mass movement forces the contents of
the sigmoid colon into the rectum the nerve endings
in its walls are stimulated by stretch. In the infant
defaecation occurs by reflex (involuntary) action.
However, sometimes in the second or third year
of life the ability to overide the defaecation reflex
is developed. In practical terms this acquired
voluntary control means that the brain can inhibit
the reflex until such time as it is convenient to
defaecate. The external anal sphincter is under
conscious control through the pudendal nerve. Thus
defaecation involves involuntary contraction of the
muscles of the rectum and relaxation of the internal
anal sphincter. Contraction of the abdominal
muscles and lowering of the diaphragm increase
the intra-abdominal pressure (Valsalva's
Manoeuvre) and so assist the process of
defaecation. When defaecation is voluntarily
postponed, the feeling of fullness and need to
defaecate tends to fade until the next mass
movement occurs and the reflex is initiated again.
Repeated suppression of the reflex may lead to
constipation.
