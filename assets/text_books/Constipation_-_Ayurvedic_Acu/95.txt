Constituents of Faeces : The faeces consist
of a semisolid brown mass. The brown color is due
to the presence of stercobilin.

Even though absorption of water takes place
in the large intestine, water still makes up about 60
to 70% of the weight of the faeces. The remainder
consists of :

e Fibre (indigestible cellular plant and animal
material)

Epithelial cell from the walls of the tract

Fatty acids

Mucus secreted by the epithelial lining of the

Large Intestine

Mucus helps to lubricate the faeces and an
adequate amount of roughage in the diet ensures
that the contents of the colon are sufficiently bulky
to stimulate defaecation.
