Similarly, the human body being made up of infinite elements on micro level, is
the constituent of nine elements on macro level and its ‘samvaya’ (togetherness) is

based on ‘Ten’ -

Infinite is the macro level study of human body related to which the Ten-origins
is the analysis at a mini level related to which the Tri-Origin is the study at micro
level. This is the main foundation of Ayurvedic Acupressure. Chinese Acupuncture
is based on five elements while the Ayurvedic Acupressure is based on ten
elements:Akash,Vayu, Agni,Jal, Prithvi, Kaal, Disha, Mann, Atma and Samvaaya
(Tam).
In Ayurveda, Infinite = Ten = Tri-stambh (pillar)
Gross => Subtle-Gross = Subtle

unique Tri-origin is the fundamental basis of entire canvas of Ayurveda. Zero is
infinite and which is nothing but infinity itself which is expressed in terms of almighty
omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence. Despite being trio it is unique and
invisible and conceptually and factually expressed as ‘Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh’ all
three related to origin, existence and destruction respectively..Scientists may not
accept this format that may be otherwise but there may not be much deviation from
it. Energy is all pervasive and basis for entire life process right from amoeba, creepers,
birds, animals, plants and human beings. It can be named differently at different
places but its colour, form and texture may not be different irrespective of place and
race. Chinese may call it ‘qui’, Japanese — ‘ki’, Koreans — ‘chi’, Indians — ‘pranas’
and Westerners may call it bio energy. All are the synonyms of one, that is, ‘pranas’.

No scientist could transplant energy system in dead body till to date. So we
have to accept the universal phenomena of life and death both are not in the domain
of scientists.
