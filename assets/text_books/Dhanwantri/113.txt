Left Atrium :

The upper chamber of the left part of the heart is known as the left atrium. Itis
corresponding to the right atrium but a little smaller in size. Its walls are a
little thick compared to right atrium. It has the openings of four blood vessels.
These four openings correspond to four pulmonary. veins. Two of these four
pulmonary veins come from the left lung and two from the right lung and
bring the oxygenated pure blood to the left atrium.

These four capillaries bringing the pure blood, called as veins, are also an
exception. This is also because of the same reason, that is, these have been
named pulmonary veins on the basis of the same principle, according to
which the capillaries carrying blood to the heart are called veins. These four
pulmonary veins bring the blood to the heart. They transport the pure blood
to the left atrium. In the left atrium, because of the contraction, the blood is
pushed and can move out only through the valve which is present in between
the left atrium and left ventricle. Due to the bloodâ€™s pressure, the door of the
valve opens and the blood reaches the left ventricle. The blood cannot return
back from the left atrium to the pulmonary veins. The reason being that the
blood inflow in the left atrium increases the pressureof the blood whose natural
flow is directed towards the ventricle. Therefore, it easily flows towards the
ventricle.As soon as the blood fills in the left ventricle, the valve automatically
closes, thus preventing the blood from returning back.
