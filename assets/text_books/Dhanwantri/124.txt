Thus, the left ventricle performs the most important function of transporting
the blood for its distribution to provide nutrients and oxygen to the tissues of
the body.

OG Heart-Valves :

In circulatory system, the valves attached to the hearts and capillaries are also
of utmost importance. These valves are in between the right atrium and right ventricle.
Left atrium and ventricle also have valves in between them. Even capillaries have
valves. Valves are actually a special kind of doors through which the ever flowing
blood finds its way. Their biggest speciality is the presence of cusps, which guard
these valves.

These valves have a strange formation. Their cusps are triangular. The side of
the cusps facing the atrium is slippery and the blood easily slips over it. But the
ventricle-side of these cusps is somewhat rough. These cusps are covered by
endocardium. In order to contro! these cusps, some thread-like structures looking
like thin chords are present. These chords are known as chordae tendinae. These
chords are tied to the hooks of the papillary muscles attached to the wails of the
ventricles. It is because of these chords that the cusps of the valves stay in its

place.
