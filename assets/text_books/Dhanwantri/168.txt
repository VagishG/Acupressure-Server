Ventricular systole Ventricular diastole

The process of muscular contraction
of atriums followed by that of ventricles is
known as systole and takes a time of 0.4
second. After this, the heart relaxes and eyetole
during this time no contraction of muscles 0.1 sec
takes place. This period of relaxation is
known as diastole. These two together |
take 0.8 seconds to complete what is ee ete oe
known as the cardiac cycle. Seeee nett

In this way, the heart uses half of its
time for work and rests during the other
half. As has been told earlier, the ‘sino-
auricular-node’ controls the contraction
and relaxation of muscles and the threads
of ‘auricular-ventricular-node’ and ‘Bundle
of His’ distribute the excitementtoallparts of THE PrcRt A piece
