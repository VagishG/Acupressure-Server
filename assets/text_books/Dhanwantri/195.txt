Heart Anatomy Glossary

The heart is a fist-sized, muscular organ that pumps
blood through the body. Oxygen-poor blood enters the right
atrium of the heart (via veins called the inferior vena cava
and the superior vena cava). The blood is then pumped into
the right ventricle and then through the pulmonary artery to
the lungs, where the blood is enriched with oxygen (and loses
carbon dioxide). The oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood is then
carried back to the left atrium of the heart via the pulmonary
vein. The blood is then pumped to the left ventricle, then the
blood is pumped through the aorta and to the rest of the body.
This cycle is then repeated. Every day, the heart pumps about
2,000 gallons (7,600 liters) of blood, beating about 100,000
times

Aorta - The biggest and longest artery (a blood vessel carrying
blood away from the heart) in the body. It carries oxygen-
tich blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the body.

Inferior Vena - A large vein (a blood vessel carrying blood to the heart)
that carries oxygen-poor blood to the right Cava atrium
from the lower half of the body.

Left Atrium - The left upper chamber of the heart. It receives oxygen-
rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary vein.

Left Ventricle - The left lower chamber of the heart. It pumps the blood
through the aortic valve into the aorta.

Mitral Valve : The valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle. It
prevents the back-flow of blood from the ventricle to the
atrium.

Pulmonary Artery - The blood vessel that carries oxygen-poor blood from
the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs.

Pulmonary Valve - The flaps between the right ventricle and the pulmonary

artery. When the ventricle contracts, the valve opens,
causing blood to rush into the pulmonary artery. When the
ventricle relaxes, the valves close, preventing the back-
flow of blood from the pulmonary artery to the right atrium.
