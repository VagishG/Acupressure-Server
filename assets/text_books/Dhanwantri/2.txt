The system proposed by Late Sir Park Jae Woo is vivid while the ‘Electro
Acupuncture’ is based on physiology and anatomy. Both have proved to be important
treatment systems in their own way. In Acupressure Shodh Prashikshan Evam
Upchar Sansthan, Allahabad, the continuous researches have resulted into the
assimilation of all school of thoughts. Consequently, ‘Ayurvedic Acupressure’ has
been developed as an entirely new branch, inheriting the principles of physiology,
anatomy and Sujok Correspondence along with the laws of Ayurveda.

Based on the analytical study of ‘Charak Sanhita’, the similarities found between
Ayurvedic Acupressure and Acupuncture is as below:

Chinese Acupuncture Ayurveda
1. Coldness Qui, Chi Prana, Chetna,Atma

3. Related Energy
Wind Akash-Non-resistant etc.
Heat Vayu — Movement etc.
Humidity Agni — Heat etc.
Dryness Jal - Coldness etc.

Prithvi — Stability etc.

also has its own unique specialities. Universe, as well as its smallest entity body,
both has similarities (correspondence). Both have infinite structures. Although being
infinite, the structures are based on ten divisions and hence have been named as
‘Ten Origin Principle’. For example, human body which is made up of infinite cells
can be broadly studied under ‘Ten’ entities as follows:
