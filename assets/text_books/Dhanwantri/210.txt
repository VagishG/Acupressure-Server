The veins begin where the capillaries end. The capillaries exchange the
nutrients and oxygen of the pure blood with the generated wastes,
especially carbon-dioxide, of cells and tissues. Here, these tiny channels
filled with impure blood transform into veins. In these spots, these channels
are extremely fine and are known as venules. Venules are formed by the
filling up of impure blood in the capillaries; hence they form a web
corresponding to that of the capillaries. All of the venules keep joining
together to form the veins. Veins are a little thicker than venules;they keep
joining with the other veins and form even bigger veins. The superior vena
cava-collecting the impure blood from the upper parts of the body and
bringing it to the right atrium is formed by the joining up of these veins. The
venules also collect blood from the lower parts of the body forming veins
and further bigger veins. These big veins join together to form the inferior

‘vena cava. The inferior vena cava carries the impure blood to the right

atrium of the heart.
