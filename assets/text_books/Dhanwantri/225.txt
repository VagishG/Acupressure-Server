Contraction and relaxation’ is a special feature of.the cardiac muscles. The
muscles of the heart do not contract and relax as per our wish. The heart muscles
move under the control of the nervous system. The muscles of the heart contain
threads from two nerves — one from sympathetic nerve and the other from vagus
nerve.

Sympathetic nerve is a branch of the sympathetic nervous system. This system
is independent in the spinal cord and the brain. However, its threads enter the nerves
emerging from the spinal cord and reach the heart. Due to the sympathetic nerve,
the rate of contraction and relaxation of the heart increases. During times of running,
exercise, anger and fear, etc. to send more blood to the organs, it is through this
nerve that signals are sent for the heart to work at an increased rate.
