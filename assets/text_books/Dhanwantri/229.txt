A weak heart is that whose formation is abnormal or defective. Formation related
abnormalities or defects are of two kinds: those which are present by birth and those
which cevelop over time.

Of those which are present by birth, the most common is - incomplete formation
of the cusps of the valve of the heart chambers. Such incompletely formed cusps
are unable to fully close the valves during contraction, and the blood which should
be flowing forward, flows backward. Hence, the big arteries are unable to carry as
much blood as required by the organs and they start to show the side-effects of this
deficiency of blood. If the valves of any one chamber are defective, then their effect
can be seen on the others.

Due to the defects of the left chambers, blood starts to collect in the sight
chambers and is not fully sent to the lungs for purification. This defect later takes
form of a stable state, known as back pressure. Due to the presence of blood in the
chamber at all times, they become habitual to dilation.

Those kids with defective heart have a lot different symptoms. Their development
stops and lips and face turn blue while crying. They develop fits, gain
unconsciousness and their rate of breathing increases. Such kids with defective
hearts must be kept under the supervision of specialists. As they get older, these
kids develop heart related diseases.
