Heart & Blood Circulatory System

O Vascular System :

The vascular system consists of a web of vessels and channels, which circulates
the fluids (blood and lymph) of the body. It provides the required nutrients to each
cell and tissue of the body Vascular System while the kidneys throw out the waste
products flowing in it. The vascular system can be divided into two parts :

1) Blood Circulatory System which includes arteries, veins and heart.

2) Lymphatic System â€” It is also made up of channels through which
lymph, a colourless fluid, flows. Lymphatic system connects with the
circulatory system and makes an additional web of veins. In veins,
lymph flows in the same direction as that of blood. This direction is
from the tissues towards the heart.

The Blood Circulatory System can be divided into two parts: heart and blood
vessels. Due to rhythmic contraction and expansion of the heart, the blood flows in
the blood vessels. The heart is known as the central heart and the blood vessels as
peripheral heart.

O Heart:

Heart is the main organ of the blood circulatory system. The blood vessels
carry pure blood from the heart, distribute it throughout the body and bring the impure
blood back to it. The nutrients obtained by the blood from food, are also brought
here. The impure blood is sent from the heart to the lungs for purification. In the
lungs, the oxygen present in the inhaled air comes in contact of the impure blood,
purifies it, from where it is sent back to the heart, and later to different parts of the
body for the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues.Blood vessels help the

heart in the work of distribution and recollection.

This work of distribution and recollection, that is, circulation of blood continues
life-long. The vessels which carry the blood towards the heart are known as veins
while the ones which carry it away from the heart are known as arteries.
