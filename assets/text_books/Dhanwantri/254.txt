In the scriptures, the age of humans has been told to be 100 years and that of
other important living beings have also been given. The age of a living being
stated in a period (yuga) is reduced by one year by the end of the hundredth
part of that period.

Features of the Heart (According to Ayurveda) —

1) are aer meNTeT: TRE mernen:| aewaTelver Eaet Wafehcrt weh: i

Ten veins having mahamool afd smaninghtal nav have been attached to the heart.
The arteries move out of the heart and spread out into branches and
sub-branches of different types. Because of these excess of branches they
are known as mahaphala.

The same organ has been named differently on the basis of functions
performed.

The arteries, ‘dhamni’ because of the sound of heart-beat, the meridians,

‘srotas’ because of secretion and the veins have been named ‘shira' because
of movability.

Mahatta, artha and hridaya are throughout synonymous to one-another.
‘Life is only possible with a healthy heart’, this is the basis of energy and
hence, is known as mahatta.

Every kind of task (purushaartha — dharma, artha, kaama, moksha) is possible
with a healthy heart, hence is known as artha.

Those blood vessels having heart as their roots are known as mahamoola
(big root).

These blood vessels carry all the three doshas (vaata, pitta, kapha).

Their work is to carry the vitality (ojasdhaatu) and enlightens the body.
Heart is the place of blood vessels which carry blood to and from the heart.

Heart is also a reservoir of blood because blood stays in it for a moment and
continues to flow again.

Ten arteries are attached to the heart. Among these, four upward, two in the
middle and four go in the downward direction.
