Â© Treatment of diseases in different parts of heart:

According to the diagram given below, on the basis of supply of blood in differ-
ent parts of the heart and impulses received by the different parts of the heart through
the nerves of the nervous system, division of the different parts of the heart should
be treated on the basis of numbers and names mentioned in the diagram and table
of meridian. For this type of treatment, on the basis of practical experience 10 verti-
cal meridians of the left hand have been selected for treatment. For the diagnosis,
either we can see the available test report or roll the probe in a straight line on the
selected meridians, specifically point number 3, 4, 5, 6. By rolling the probe on
these points, pain or node can be felt for which the related meridian is expected to
be treated. Hence, on the confirmed report that the functioning of the heart of the
patient is being affected in one form or another, in such a situation, after diagnosis,

treatment should be given as follows.
Treatment Protocol:

i) General treatment :

Treatment should be given on every related meridian in the form of 3. 6
tone 4, 5 sedate. After the examination by probe, if more than one
meridian is affected, for general treatment put methi on a wide tape and
apply it on the pitta falanx of left SF as shown in the diagram below.
