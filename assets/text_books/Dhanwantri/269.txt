In the left small finger, ten meridian s of heart circulation have been pointed by
treating whose related meridians different parts of heart such as aorta, right atrium
and ventricle, SA node, left atrium and ventricle, apex, septum can be separately
treated. For this, the meridian related to each part of the heart should be treated with
4,5 3, 6. For the treatment of the 10 arteries and 10 parts of the heart, the horizontal
and spiral meridians on the left small finger should be treated.

Although treating both types of meridians for the heart is slightly off the present
topic, yet it is important. In the modern world, patients are most afraid of heart diseases
and for its treatment different types of tests- stress test, angiography, echo, E.C.G.
(Electro Cardio Gram) need to be taken, Through angiography, it is clearly determined
which one of the ten arteries is blocked. Hence, according to the nomenclature in
human physiology,names and treatment region of the 10 arteries of the heart are
being given, and for their treatment 10 spiral meridians in the left small finger have

been shown by treating which Bypass surgery etc. can be avoided.

Case History :

Some years ago, former honourable judge of Allahabad High Court went through
angiography in a top hospital of Delhi and most arteries of the heart were found to
be 50-70 % damaged. The honourable judge took a time of two months from the
doctors and began his treatment in the Sansthan. After a two month treatment on
spiral meridian, angiography done by the same hospital of Delhi reported removal
of blockage from the arteries. This situation was astonishing for the doctors. The
honourable judge himself told about this incident and treatment protocol in a training
camp organised by the Sansthan. .
