Heart is the most prominent place of vitality. Hence, it has been given the
titles of:
i) collection of energy (prana)
ii) mahatt (important/prominent among body organs)
iii) artha (moving)

18) Heart having the knowledge of touch, and life, the combined form of body,
senses, mind and soul are dependent on the heart. It is also worthy of
worship for being the place for yoga, the follower of moksha.

19) In the states of Epilepsy, Hysteria, greed, unconsciousness and
drunkenness, the patient has no control over his body and although the
people consider him fainted, yet his heart continues to work.

20) Hence, energy is not that much synonymous to life as universe’ relation
with the knowledge of living beings.

21) The impulses sent to the body and sense organs reach our brain where
they are related to the mind. The mind further connects them with the soul.
All these are the functions of life (dhaari/jeevit) and take place in the heart,
that is nervous system runs by blood/heart.

22) When the person becomes unconscious, even then the heart continues to

beat. Further when it stops beating and the person dies, in the post-mortem
the defect is still found in the brain, not in the heart.
Hence, there surely is an element in the brain which governs the heart,
provides originality, creates coordination among the different organs and
generates the habit to perform the various movements and functions of the
organs in the various symptoms of life.

23) By mentioning the heart as mahatt, it has been accepted as intellect of the
brain because:

1) the knowledge of touch (senses) resides in the heart. Touches are

of two types -
i) by the sense organ — skin
ii) by the mind
