Position - The heart is a hollow muscular organ. It is made of a specific type of
muscles, known as cardiac muscles. It is located in the chest (thorax) in-between
the lungs and above the diaphragm. Its shape is somewhat conical and is about the
size of owner's fist. Its weight is about 300 grams (10 ounce). The upper part of the
heart is comparatively wide and is known as the Base of the Heart. The lower narrow
part is known as the Apex of the Heart and is slightly bent in the frontal-left direction.
The Base of the Heart is slightly inclined towards the right. The Apex of the Heart
reaches the middle of the 5th and 6th Left Ribs. By touching this region on the chest,
the heartbeat can be felt, by which its position can be easily recognized.A number
of big’arteries and veins move into and out of the heart from near the Base of the
Heart.
