As it was mentioned before while discussing the topic of blood circulation, the
main function of blood is related to nutrition and circulation. Blood provides energy
to each part of the body by providing nutrition. This job is done by the arteries. The
blood collects wastes and toxins during circulation and brings them to the heart
through veins. After the purification of blood by the lungs, the heart again sends
pure blood through the arteries for the nutrition of each cell. Where nutrition is
provided by the arteries, there is important contribution of the veins in cleaning up
the body by removing the wastes. Node in any part of the head â€” in any form, obstructs
the blood supply of that area. Nutrition becomes lower and lower while increase in
waste is natural. Hence, from the formation of pus in that area to infectious disease
like tuberculosis or dangerous diseases like cancer, anything is possible. Hence,
purification of blood through veins is of utmost importance. In Ayurvedic Acupressure,
where on one hand meridians of hundreds of arteries have been marked, on the
other meridians of veins in the same amount have been marked likewise.
