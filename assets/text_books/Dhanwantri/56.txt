In females, infection generally occurs in the vaginal orifice of vagina because
this part of reproductive system being exposed can be easily infected during urination
at dirty places in comparison to males due to difference in structure. Internal infection
can have many causes, chronic infection occurs due to the production of
asatmyadhatu by the microbes and toxins present in the gastro-intestinal tract.
Leucorrhoea, inflammation in reproductive region, back-pain, etc. are its symptoms.
Females generally ignore leucorrhoea. Its time period signals the seriousness of
the disease.

The nerves and blood vessels of the pelvic and groin area get compressed due
to the presence of fibroids in uterus. So, symptoms of back-pain, sciatica, leg-pain,
knee-pain and pelvic-pain with pain in other joints, etc. appear which are associated
diseases. Hence, these cannot be permanently treated without the treatment of the
cause, that is fibroid and cyst. Ayurvedic Acupressure is based on holistic approach
and the combination of each organ of the body with other organs through meridians
and the cordial removal of a number of diseases with a single treatment is its major
speciality.

In addition to the 10 horizontal meridians on the right thumb, by treating 0/9, 1/
8, 2/7 LVM or 7, 8, 9 VM, the treatment of pain from the head to the legs, back-pain
and reproductive system is given which cordially treats the migraine, cervical, heart-
borne diseases and diseases related to the reproductive system. These have been
presented by way of treatment protocol.
