The blood flows in the body through the heart and in the blood vessels. K starts
its journey from a point, flows in the entire body and reaches back its initial point,
and this cycle continues lifelong. Thus, blood flows in a closed circuit. The cycle of
flow of blood is as follows:

Left ventricle > Aorta > Arteries Arterioles> Capillaries >Venules>
Veins > Vena cava (superior and inferior) > Right atrium > Right ventricle >
Pulmonary Artery > Pulmonary Vein > Left Atrium > Left Ventricle

The blood follows this cycle and flows through the entire body as long as.the

person is alive.
