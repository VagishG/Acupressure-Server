Similar to the female reproductive system mentioned before, classification of
the different parts of the male reproductive organ has been given in the table. The
treatment of diseases related to them can be given on 10 horizontal meridians or 5
RLHM of the right thumb or right big toe. The reproductive system in males is
governed by the prostate gland. It provides the collection of sperms and important
reproduction-related hormone. In males, the disease of prostate gland begins in the
middle age and takes the form of a common disease in old age. Excess urination
(polyurea) in old age due to weakening of the muscles of the reproductive region,
obstruction in urination, no complete urination at a time, incontinence, applying
pressure for urination, night urination, excess urination (normal is 5 to 6 times); all
these are symptoms of diseases of prostate gland. Impotency, lesser excitement,
infection at the tip of the penis, itching, itching and eczema in scrotum, nil production
of sperm, blockage in the left or right duct, prostate cancer, etc. are the main diseases
of male reproductive organ.
