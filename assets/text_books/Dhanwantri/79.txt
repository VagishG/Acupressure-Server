0 Chambers of the Heart :

The heart is a hollow organ. Its inner hollow region is divided into two parts, left
and right, by the longitudinal-septum. Both of these chambers are not related to
each other, that is they are independent of each other. The left part is concerned
with the flow of pure blood while the right part is concerned with that of impure
blood.

Both the left and right parts are subdivided by a transverse septum and form an
upper and lower chamber, Hence, the whole inner region of the heart is divided into
four chambers. The upper right chamber is known as right atrium and the lower right
chamber is known as right ventricle.

Similarly, the upper left chamber is known as left atrium and the lower left
chamber is known as left ventricle.

In comparison to ventricles, the atriums are thin-walled. The two ventricles pump
out the blood like a distributing pump. Thus, the ventricles'have to do more work in
comparison to atriums, and this is why they are thick walled.
