Inferior vena cava.

The left atrium and ventricle are connected through a valve. Similarly, the right
atrium and ventricle are also connected through a valve. These valves have flaps
attached to them. The flaps are attached in such a way that the blood can only flow
from the atrium to the ventricle. This is why the blood flow in the heart is unidirectional.
The channels carrying the blood related to the different chambers of the heart also
have their openings in the respective chambers. The structure related description of
each chamber of the heart has been given in the following lines —

1. Right Atrium :

The right atrium is that part of the heart in which the impure blood which
travels in the whole body is collected. The venules which carry the impure
blood in the body join together to form veins.Similarly, the veins coming from
all directions join together to form the vena cava. The veins coming from the
upper parts of the body form the superior vena cava and the veins coming
from the lower parts of the body form the inferior vena cava, both of which
bring the impure blood to this chamber.
