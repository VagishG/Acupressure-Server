1. Indigestion & Heart Burn :

This is common disease but its repetition with pain around diaphragm (in upper
abdomen and lower chest) makes it special. Ignorance leads to headache and migraine.

Pain with soar taste of mouth, belching and burning feeling in the chest, etc. are
general symptoms.

In gastritis heat increases and forms acidity, because heat moves upwards therefore
burning sensation is observed in throat and chest. This further dissolves in-blood and
makes blood acidic which is responsible for miscellaneous inflammatory diseases. _-
