Coarseness, liquidity, mobility, hotness and non- interruption are the specific characters
of Prithvi, ap, Vayu, Tejas and Akash respectively. All these characters are perceivable by

the tactile sense organ because touch alongwith its absence is known by the tactile sense
organ.

At the time of dissolution, the self gets attached from these enjoyable entities. Thus
(the self), subdued by rajas and tamas, gets manifested from the unmanifest state and then
reverts to the unmanifest and then moves continuously like a wheel (from one state to

another). Those who are attached excessively to duals and are engrossed by ego are
subjected to origin and destruction but not others who are contrary to them.
