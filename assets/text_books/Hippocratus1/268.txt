32) Constipation :

Constipation is not a disease; this is a measure of the function of intestines and
body. How stool generates? Small intestine transfers the unabsorbed fluid to large
intestine; there it resides for 10 to 12 hours. Here few ions and water is absorbed as
per requirement of body, and these unwanted elements are transformed into vitamins
by bacteria residing in large intestine, rest unwanted substance is transferred to sigmoid
colon with mucous. Here this substance is mixed with mucous and transferred to rectum.
Under healthy condition this semi-solid waste is excreted daily.

If mucous is not mixed properly in this waste or water is absorbed more than
required or absence of defecation reflex gives condition to constipation.

Constipation usually depends on diet, body labour and mental conditions. Besides
this and seasonal changes, malfunctioning of organs, are responsible too. Treatment
should be given under proper diagnosis. This could be diagnosed by examining the
