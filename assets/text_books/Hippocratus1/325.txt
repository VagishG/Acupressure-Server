Pre-renal :

Pre-Renal or blood realated causes : Kidney is healthy but formation of urea
is due to over working of kidney. e.g. internal haemorrhage, heamtemesis
(vomiting with blood), mismatch transfusion of blood, dehydration, shock,
myocardial infarction. Under above circumstances if blood supply is below
normal level (Renal ischemia) renal failure may happen.

Renal :

Renal or Nephropathies: any type of renal sickness increases the urea level
in kidney before renal failure.

Post Renal :
Kidney is completely healthy. but urea level in blood increases because flow

of urine obstructs due to oliguria or anuria due to disorders of ureter, urethra,
prostate gland or Urinary bladder.

Symptoms of Renal Failure :
