26) Tuberculosis :

This disease happens due to low immune profile by micro bacteria called
Tuberculae. This is a primary infection in each new born baby. Babyâ€™s immune system
self cures this disease (without any external symptoms) and gifts acquired immunity
against bacteria. The sign of infection is found in one of the lungs throughout the life.

These bacteria germinate any time during low immune profile throughout the life.
Usually this enters in body via airways therefore lungs are mostly infected, but these
bacteria can infect other organs too viz. throat, intestines, kidney, lungs, gonads, brain,
skin and eyes.

Lymph nodes are another most wanted residence of these bacteria because these
nodes produce antibodies therefore these again-and-again fight to defeat them.

Primary Symptoms: slight fever (especially in evening), lack of appetite, tiredness,
dry cough (in Lungs TB).

Infected organ is the best food of these bacteria and is capable to finish it in
whole. Later it chews the whole body in multiple years.

In some cases this bacteria infects the whole body (Milary TB)
