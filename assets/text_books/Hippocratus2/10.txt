e  Alkalosis refers to a high pH in tissue.

e Alkalemia refers to a high pH in the blood.

Respiratory Alkalosis :

e Respiratory Alkalosis is a medical condition in which increased respiration
(hyperventilation) elevates the blood pH (a condition generally called
alkalosis). It is one of four basic categories of disruption of acid-base

_ homeostasis.

Metabolic Alkalosis :

e Metabolic Alkalosis is a metabolic condition in which the pH of tissue is
elevated beyond the normal range (7.35 — 7.45). This is the result of decreased
hydrogen ion concentration, leading to increased bicarbonate, or alternatively
a direct result of increased bicarbonate concentrations.
