13) Rheumatoid Arthritis :

This is most crippling from of arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an inflammatory
disease that damages the synovial tissue connecting bones and joints. It is one of most
cirppling form of arthritis. It is not known what triggers the immune system to produce
the substances that cause inflammation, which can destroy all components of the joint.

Usually synovial membranes are smooth but in this disease they become rough
and concave dotted tissue called Pannus. This influences joint(s) cavity. Pannus secretes
an enzyme that destroys cartilages, bone and soft tissues. This creates contraction in
tendons and causes bone fusion by destroying the mobility of joints. If tendons expand
and crack then joints become loose-loopy.

In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation begins in the synovial membrane (A). The
synovial membrane begins to proliferate and forms extra tissue called pannus
(B). Cells in the pannus release enzymes that eat into the cartilage, bone
(erosions), and soft tissues (C). Finally, the tendons and joint capsule may
become inflamed and shorten, causing bone fusion (D).
