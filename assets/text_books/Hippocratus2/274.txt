14) Degenerative Arthritis Due to Raised CRP

C-reactive protein is a protein found in the blood, the levels of which rise in
response to inflammation. Its physiological role is to bind to phosphocholine expressed
on the surface of dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate
the complement systems via the CIQ complex.

CRP is synthesized by liver in response to factors released by fat cells.

It was elevated in people with a variety of illness including cancer. However
discovery of hepatic synthesis demonstrated that it is a native protein.

CRP is a member of the class of acute phase reactant , as its level rises dramatically
during inflammatory process occuring in the body. The increment is due to a rise in the
plasma concentration.

It is also believed to play another important role in innate immunity as an early
defence system against infections. Elevated level of CRP are at an increased risk of
diabetes, hypertention and cardiovascular disease as well as in cancer.
