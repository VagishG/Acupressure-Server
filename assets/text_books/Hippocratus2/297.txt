14) Small Pox:

It can happen in any age group. Incubation period is 10 â€” 11 days.

It is caused by severe infection of Variola major virus which enters in blood via

breath and increases its mass and enters in cells.

Symptoms : initialize with fever and headache.

Further:

1) Within three days rashes filled with fluid appear on skin (more on face and
limbs).

2) These rashes are inflated with pus in next 3 days, fever raises and patient
suffers from unconsciousness. This is a serious condition because virus
enters in internal organs. These pustules enter in dermis layer of skin,

therefore after a week when these pustules dry and the scab drops, they leave
deep scar on skin, and these scabs (skin sheddings) are infectious.

This virus can accompany other diseases viz. Broncopneumonia, Cornial ulcer,
Ostitis media, Myocardits and encephalitis.
