5) Pharyngitis & Uvulitis :

Muscle and fiber like structure hanging in upper palate of oral cavity is called
Uvula. This works as lymphatic nodule for pharyngeal cavity. Usually pharynx and uvula
both are infected at the same time. Due to infection, size of uvula increases and touches
pharynx. This creates irritation and small whoops. Mucous membrane secretes more
mucous which is excreted with whooping cough else patient feels breathlessness. This
infection drops down to larynx & trachea.
