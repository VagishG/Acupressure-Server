Indigestion or Dyspepsia :

7 When the food is not wholly digested or the digestion does not happen on time is
called indigestion. This is the result of hypo acidity.

When the stomach fire is down the food becomes rotten. When the food is rotten
first gas is formed and then wind is formed. This wind creates burning in stomach, neck
and chest. If its quantity increases it moves any where in the whole body, because air is
free, it can't be stopped by anyone, it cannot be caught by anyone, therefore it reaches
the head and produces headache, back pain and vertigo. Then by the rotten food first
acidity is formed (this is not due to the acid situated in the stomach, this is of rotten
food; like if dal and vegetable becomes rotten then it becomes sour without putting any
acid in it.) which gives birth to many types of diseases. Now if hypo cidity becomes
more old it creates many other diseases like ulcer, piles, fistula, fissure and cholestrol.
In Ayurved it can be said that by hypo acidity 103 types of diseases ocur in which
first comes acidity and cancer is kept at 103 number, whose list we are trying to give
here :
