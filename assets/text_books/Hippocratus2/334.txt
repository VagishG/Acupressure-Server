Asthma

As discussed earlier, “In acupressure all acute and chronic diseases occur due to
imbalance of five or ten elements”. Any treatment cannot be successful till imbalance
of these elements are not properly diagnosed.

Generally : Asthma or breathlessness is an uncontrollable disease and patient
cannot get rid of it. But in acupressure it is curable if diagnosed properly. Usually it is
related with lungs.

In acupressure organs are paired as following:
1) Lungs & large intestine

2) Heart & small intestine

3) Spleen & stomach

4) Liver & gall bladder

5) Kidney & urinary bladder

Integrated functions of these paired organs are not defined in other theories, but
in view of science of human physiology we find that large intestine and small intestine
are the most wanted residence of parasites and microbes. During their long term
residence they receive nutrients from food and excrete toxins. Repetition of this results
the increase of toxins in blood and other tissues. This affects the functions of lungs
and heart therefore breathlessness is a vital symptom along with other symptoms. Grey
or blue color of lungs. Correspondence i in palm is the special symptom of lungs asthma.
Haemorrhoid with skin dis diseases, c constipation, etc. large intestine related diseases are
the other symptoms. Worms in intestines is the other main cause of breathing disorder
in children.

Breathlessness while walking is the main symptom of heart related asthma.
Carbohydrate, fat and protein is absorbed by small intestine for the formation of blood.
Due to malfunctioning of small intestine, toxins are transferred in blood, therefore
heart needs to work hard, which leads to breathing disorders.
