HAEMORRHAGE:
Haemorrhage- blood leaking from circulatory system

Bleeding can occur when blood leak from Blood vessel inside the body or externally
either through a natural opening such as mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina, anus, or
through ulcerative skin. Loss of volume of blood or the complete loss of blood may
cause death typically healthy person can tolerate of 10 to 15% of total blood volume
without serious medical difficulties. The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called
as Stasis. It is an important of both; first aid and surgery. Hemorrhaging is classified
into following four classes:

Class I
involves upto 15% of blodd loss. There is no change in vital time sickness.
Class II

Haemorrhage involve 15% to 30% blood loss. In such cases patient is having
rapid heart- beat and there is no narrow difference between Systolic and Diastolic
blood pressure. In such cases patient look face and feel cool to the touch. Therefore,
there is slight change in system blood transfusion is not required.

Class Ill

It is loss of 30% to 40% of total blood circulation. Blood pressure drops, heart
rate increases, shock and the mental status becomes worst. In such cases transfusion is
necessary and required.

Class IV

Following bleeding more than 40%. The instant measures are required to prevent
death.

Individuals in excellent physical and cardiovascular shape may have more effective
compensatory mechanisms before experiencing cardiovascular collapse. These patients
may look deceptively stable, with minimal derangements in vital signs, while having
poor peripheral perfusion. Elderly patients or those with chronic medical conditions
may have less tolerance to blood loss, less ability to compensate, and may take
medications such as betablockers that can potentially blunt the cardiovascular response.
Care must be taken in the assessment of these patients.
