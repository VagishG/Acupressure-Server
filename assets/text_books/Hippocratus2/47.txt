In common with Abrasion, this is caused by
mechanical destruction of the skin, although it usually
has an underlying medical cause.

Caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes
blood to collect under the skin.

Irregular wound caused by blunt impact to soft tissue
overlying hard tissue or tearing such as in child birth.
In some instances, this can also be used to describe
an incision.

A cut into a body tissue or organ, such as by a scalpel,
made during surgery.

Caused by an object that penetrated the skin and
underlying layers, such as a nail, needle or knife.
Also known as a bruise, this is a blunt trauma damaging
tissue under the surface of the skin.
