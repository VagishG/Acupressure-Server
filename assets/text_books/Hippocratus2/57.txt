11) Fat Metabolic Disorder :

Fat is present in blood in the form of triglyceride, cholesterol and phospholipids
(app. 260-400 mg/100 ml. serum). All of these create new combinations of blood

lipids with the different ratio of protein; because blood lipids do not dilute in

water therefore they create a complex element with the help of apo-protein dilutable

in water.

Hyperlipidaemia : This condition is created due to hereditary disorders. This is

divided into three parts as per different ratio of triglyceride, cholesterol and
phospholipids.

1)

2)

3)

Triglyceride (TG-N), LDL (low density lipo-protein) and cholesterol (++).
Such patient is always under risk of Atherosclerosis, heart problems due to
anemia, hypertension (HBP) and cerebral haemorrhage. Xanthoma (swollen
cells) is seen in such patients.

Triglyceride (TG++), cholesterol (N), LDL & VLDL (+) - Usually seen in
obese people whose body is deshaped. Blood glucose and uric acid ++ is
found in patients suffering with Pancreatitis and heart problems affiliated to
low blood volume.

Increased level of Chylomicron :

Fatty acids, cholestrol and triglyceride absorbed in intestines are transported
in blood through lymph. Chylomicrons are big molecules, absorbed by
lipoprotein lipase enzyme situated in capillary endothelium. In absence of
lipoprotein lypase chylomicron in blood resides as it is and disturbs the
function of cells especially capillaries.

Preliminary patient feels recurrent abdominal pain and further liver and spleen
are enlarged. Possibility of pancreatitis is seen. Exogeneous
Hypertriglysrodenea is found.
