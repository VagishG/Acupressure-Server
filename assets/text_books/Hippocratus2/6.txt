Biochemistry
All bio chemistry is based on mainly hydrogen ions :

The chemical nature of any element (acidic / alkaline) depends on the give
and take of the hydrogen ion after that element has dissolved in water.

The compounds which dissolve in water and give hydrogen ions are called
acidic and the compounds which engulf the hydrogen ions present in water
are called alkaline. â€˜ RY
