. Inorganic element is present in the form of soluble ions in water. There is no
pure water anywhere in the human body. Due to the dissolved ions in water it
is called fluid. All these ions have electric charge (Na*, K*,Cr, so. rey All
these ions are movable in electric fluid. The original nature of these fluids is
neutral or light acidic / alkaline. Why? Though the carbonic elements of body
are acidic, the other fluids of the body are neutral or alkaline.

Why?

The reason is the responsibility to neutralize the hydrogen ions which take
birth continuously.

Hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are in similiar quantity in pure water at 25°.
H,0 «+ H* +OH™

The concentration of H* ions in pure water pH = 7 (Neutral).

When we increase ten times H", at this level pH = 6 (Acid) &

When we decrease ten times H’, at this level pH = 8 (Alkali)
