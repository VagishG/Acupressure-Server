e Human blood is slightly alkaline (basic) with a pH between 7.3 and 7.5.
If the pH of blood drops below 7.3, acidosis occurs. If the blood pH rises
above 7.5, alkalosis occurs. Death will occur if blood pH goes below
7.0 or above 7.8. ;

The sources of hydrogen ion in the body :

¢ Due to food, water and cellular metabolism (330 litre CO,) everyday
80m Eq hydrogen ions are produced in human body.

Cg Hyp 05 +6 07 > 6 H,O+6CO, +27 ATP T
Uses of acidic nature in the body :
e Formation of salt with the help of alkali produced by cells.
e Production of energy from hydrogen ion.

Electrical flow in acids like in battery (flow of impulse in the nerves of body)
e Activation of respiratory centres by hydrogen ion.

Maintainance or regulation of hydrogen ion in the body :

e A buffer system (within seconds to minute)

e — Exhalation of CO, by Lungs (within mins. to hour).

e Excretion of H* by Kidneys (within hours to days)
Defects from hydrogen ion in the body :

e Human life is possible on the normal pH of blood. When it is less or more
than normal, enzymes present in cellular mitochondria become inactive and
because its work is energy production, the energy production closes and the
patient dies.

Genesis of Diseases :

Imbalance between production and excretion of hydrogen ion causes disease.
Stages of Disease :

e Respiratory Acidosis

e Metabolic Acidosis

e Respiratory Alkalosis

e@ = Metabolic A]kalosis
