Respiratory Acidosis :

Metabolic Acidosis :

Acidosis refers to a low pH in tissue.

Acidemia refers to a low pH in the
blood.

Respiratory Acidosis is a medical
condition in which decreased
ventilation (hypoventilation) causes
increased blood carbon dioxide
concentration and decreased pH
(a condition generally called
acidosis).

Metabolic Acidosis is a condition that
occurs when the body produces too
much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body.
Ifunchecked, metabolic acidosis leads to acidemia, i.e., blood pH is low (less
than 7.35) due to increased production of hydrogen by the body or the inability
of the body to form bicarbonate (HCO;) in the kidney.
