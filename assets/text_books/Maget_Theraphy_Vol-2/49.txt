Traumatic bleeding is caused by some type of injury. There are different

@ = Abrasion - Also called a graze, this is caused by
transverse action of a foreign object against the skin, and usually does
not penetrate below the epidermis.
@ = Excoriation - In common with Abrasion, this is caused
by mechanical destruction of the skin, although it usually has an
underlying medical cause.

Hematoma - Caused by damage to a blood vessel that
in turn causes blood to collect under the skin.
@ __sLeceration - Irregular wound caused by blunt impact to

soft tissue overlying hard tissue or tearing such as in child birth. In some
instances, this can also be used to describe an incision.

@ Incision - A cut into a body tissue or organ, such as
by a scalpel, made during surgery.

@ Puncture Wound-â€” Caused by an object that penetrated the
skin and underlying layers, such as a nail, needle or knife.

@  Contusion - Also known as a bruise, this is a blunt
trauma damaging tissue under the surface of the skin.
@ Crushing Injuries - Caused by a great or extreme

amount of force applied over a period of time. The extent of a crushing
injury may not immediately present itself.
