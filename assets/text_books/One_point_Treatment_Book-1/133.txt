How you see and remember:

1. Signals from the eye travel to visual cortex in
the occipital lobe and then to several other
regions of the brain to interpret visual
stemuli,allowing the brain to see the shapes.

2. For shapes to be recognised and the word, to
be understood, another part of the brain called
Wemicke's area and near by structure are used.

3. Tne hippocampus, deep inside the brain, is
required for storing recent memories.

4. Long term memories are stored in the cerebral
cortex.
