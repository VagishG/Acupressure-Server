CHAPTER - 1
The Therapeutic Importance of Colours

From ancient times Acupressure method is used in our
country from centuries in some form or other to gain health.
Sages have been used pressure or message on various
points of body for treatment. These points have been written
in our ancient book Ayurveda known as ‘Marm’. With the
change of time this method also developed and afterwords
the treatment was also given by needle. The most vivid
example of this is the mention of treatment by piercing needles
on the body during Mahabharta period is available. Later this
method was taken by followers of Buddhism to Sri Lanka,
China and Japan and its entire and proper development took
place in China. Today, this method is evolving in different
ways in different regions of the world, such as reflexology in
America, Shiyastu in Japan, Acupuncture in China, Electro-
Acupuncture in Germany and in Korea and Russia in the
form of Sujok Acupuncture invented by Late Prof. Park.

Acupuncture is made up of two words. Acu means
needle and puncture means piercing. Health is earned by
disintegrating the toxins arising from the body by penetrating
the needles on different points. In place of needle if pressure
is applied on these points by fingers then it is called
Acupressure. Apart from these two methods, treatment can
be done by applying few colours on these points only. But for
that the knowledge of reflexology or the Chinese classical
meridian and the points and principles related to it are absolute
