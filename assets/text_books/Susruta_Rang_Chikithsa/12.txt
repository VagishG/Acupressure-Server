Our body is made up of the smallest living unit cell. These
cells are innumberable amounts in the body. Cells can be
seen only by a microscope. These cells also have the ability
to increase fertility, i.e. self growth. This is an interesting fact
that man's structure consists of only two cells increasing the
growth of sperm and ovaries. These two male and female
cells divide themselves and make the infant in the womb of
the woman.

Structure of Cell :

Each cell is made up of a jelly-like substance. It is called
organism. There is a nucleus in the middle of the organism. A
thin membrane is covered around the cell called cell
membrane. The nucleus is an important part of the cell which
controls its structure and birth activities. There are genes in
this nucleus which is made up of R. N. A. and D. N. A. These
genes are the carriers of heredity characters (from one
generation to other generation). By these the cell produces
the same cells. Cells are destroyed after some time of
development and new cells are formed in place of them. Many
cells of the same type together make tissues.

Structure of Tissue :

There are different types of cells for different functions
in the human body. Many cells of the same type, which form
together the structure, are called tissues.
