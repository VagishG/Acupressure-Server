Bones are the most inside part of the body. Hollow
space is inside long bones in which a sponge-like substance
is filled. This forms blood. It is called Bone Marrow.

Two or three bones and muscles and ligaments together
make the body joints e.g. elbow joint, knee joint etc.

The human body is made up of various organs and
systems. Each of them has some important functions. Man
remains unaware of these tasks but they keep moving
throughout life. We have to be amazed to see these science
related actions and arrangements of the body e.g. about 350
grams of cardiac muscles made Heart circulates 5% liters of
blood in the whole body in one minute. In 24 hours, heart
pumps approximately 2000 liters of blood. Similarly, both the
Kidneys of 300 grams, filter out approximately 17 litres of
blood a day and prepare urine around one liter. The body is
full of such many more surprising facts.

When many organs perform a particular function of
the body with mutual synergy, the group of these organs is
called system. Mouth, salivary glands, stomach, pancreas
and liver collectively do the work of digestion of food.
So all of them belong to the digestive system. Similarly, the
heart and various blood vessels together form a circulatory
system. The brief description of the main systems is given
below.
