1. Circulatory System :

As mentioned above, this system is made up of mainly
heart and blood vessels. Blood vessels spread throughout
the body. If all types of blood vessels are measured then
their length is several thousand kilometers.

The heart is made up of many specific types of muscles
which is divided into two parts right and left. These two parts
have no relation between them but both parts are divided into
upper and lower parts. And among them there are valves -
which open only one side. The blood can come from the upper
chamber but it can not go back. In this way there are four
chambers in the heart.

There is pure blood in the left chambers of the heart
which is circulated in the body by the arteries due to the
contraction of the left ventricle. There is impure blood in the
right chambers which comes from all body by veins. This
blood is sent to the lungs by pulmonary artery by the
contraction of right ventricle where the oxygen mixes in the
blood by respiratory action and the carbon dioxide is released.
In this way when the blood is purified, it is circulated by
pulmonary artery to the left chamber of heart. From there
blood is circulated in the whole body by left ventricle. In this
way the process of circulation continues. In general, the heart
transmits blood in the body by pulsating 70 to 75 times in one
minute.
