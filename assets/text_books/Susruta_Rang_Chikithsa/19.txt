2. Respiratory System :

The respiratory system consists of nose, the nasal tract
and both lungs.

Inhale and exhale by lungs is called the respiratory order.
Inhalation is called inspiration and breathing out is called
expiration. When fresh air fills in the lungs, then it comes in
contact with blood by very fine blood vessels. During this
time, carbon dioxide, humidity and volatile harmful substance
gets out and oxygen mixes in it.
