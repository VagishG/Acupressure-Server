necessary. So, in the next pages subtle discussion about
these principles is given.

Our sages had complete knowledge of the use of
colours. Our Indian calender begins at the arrival of spring
on the month of phalgun and this time Holi being the most
important festival, Indian people irrigate the whole body with
natural colours like yellow, red, green and abir, which had an
impact on the immune system of our body. Throughout the
year, due to all weather changes and other reasons, the ability
of the body to fight against germs and bacteria of disease is
generated. Unhealthiness was also rare in comparison to
today but defiance of principles predicted by nature and
ancestors started happening on the occasion of holi and
gradually the body began losing its ability to fight diseases
and today the results are in front of us.

Proper use of colour can be understood by another
example. In our country since ancient times married women
used to have a red dot on the forehead in the middle of both
eyebrows. Red colour increases the flow of blood in the body.
From the scientific view, this place is related to pituitary gland
causing all the endocrine glands of the body to excite and
secrete different types of hormones due to which loyalty is
maintained in women.

On the contrary, our ancestors have advised the widow
women to apply chandan on the forehead to mitigate the desire
of ram. In this way, the importance of colour has been known
and used by our ancestors in body meditation in some way.
But today, the vicious cycle of rising disease has given rise
