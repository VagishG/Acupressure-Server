to many alternative therapies in which Acupressure and
Acupuncture using colours plays its importance (whose in
modern times Korea's great thinker, philosopher and scientist
Sir Park J. Woo has laid the foundation stone). Through this
the physical and paradoxical analogy principle has been
established by which evolution of an amazing therapy has
occured in the world of Acupuncture and the whole world is
getting benefitted. A country like India, where there is a heavy
burden of population and the level of life is very far below the
poverty line and the living society surrounded by various
types of pollution is suffering from dreaded diseases in which
treatment requires expenditure of unlimited health and energy.
In such an environment, sujok onnuri (whole body) medicine
propounded by Late Prof. Park is a miraculous invention. Next
in this part, method of treatment using colours by principles
of this therapy is being mentioned.

They are all based on using the TCM points on Sujok
correspondence system, an easy method developed by
Acupressure Sansthan, Allahabad.
