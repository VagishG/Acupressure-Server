4. Digestive System :

In Digestive system, the organs are mouth, salivary
glands, food pipe, Stomach, Duodenum, Pancreas Gland,
Liver, Large Intestine, Small Intestine etc. The digestive
system varies by digesting various foods in such a way that
the body can use them for energy and growth.

When some food is chewed by the teeth, saliva present
in salivary glands mixes in it. Saliva is alkaline liquid which is
helpful in digestion of starch. Saliva transforms starch in sugar.
It also works to dilute the food so that it could easily go into
the stomach by throat.

The stomach is like a big pouch. When saliva mixed
food goes into it, hydrochloric acid which is present in the
glands of stomach walls, mixes in food. Then after the food is
grinded by the movement in the muscles of stomach and
after some time (3 to 5 hours) it goes in the duodenum. In
duodenum, the food comes in the form of liquid and bile juice
which comes from gall bladder mixes in it. The bile and
duodenum juices eliminate the acidity of food and then makes
it alkaline again.

After this the food comes in the small intestine. Small
Intestine also secrets alkaline juice which mixes in the food.
Here the digested food also absorbs in the walls of small
intestine. The food goes ahead by the peristaltic movement
of the intestines. About 7 meter long small intestine absorbs
all the essential elements of the food during 5 to 7 hours.
