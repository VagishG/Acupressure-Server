Nerves are spread throughout the body. Some of these come
straight from the brain. These are called cranial nerves. There
are 12 pairs of cranial nerves. The remaining many nerves
come from different parts of the spinal cord. These are 31
pairs. The entire body is operated by these nerves.

The brain has two major components. First small brain
and second large brain. Different areas of large brain work
differently. As pain, touch, hot, cold etc. is felt by these areas
of brain. Some do the work of thinking. Memory also remains
in this large brain.

The left brain controls the right side of the body and the
right side brain controls the left side of the body.

Small brain controls the movements of different muscles.
It regulates the movement of joints of body and the movement
of walking.

6. Muscular System :

Different muscles form this system. The body is
operated by muscles on the messages of different movements
by the nervous system.

There are two types of muscles in the human body :

1) Those mucles which are powered by self-will e.g.

the muscles of hands, legs, tongue etc. These are
called voluntary muscles.
