Female Reproductive System

Ovary gland produces ovum or egg and Testes
produces sperms. When ova and sperm meet the embryo
formation occurs.

It is worthy to mention that the egg and sperms each
has half half 23 chromosomes. When the ovum and sperms
meet then the embryo has full 46 chromosomes.

Birth of a boy or girl depends on sex chromosomes.
This is of two types X and Y. Girl's Ovum has pair of X-X
type chromosomes. During sex if the women's X chromosome
meets with Man's X chromosome then the girl is born. During
sex if women X chromosome meets with man's
Y-chromosome then the boy is born. In this way birth of a
boy or girl depends on X-Y chromosomes.
