then water apsorption is less by the kidneys.
Thereby increases urine volume and urine also
contains sugar. It is called diabities insipidus. Higher
amount of this hormone increases blood pressure.

b) Thyroid Gland :

c)

This important gland is located at the bottom of the neck.
There are two parts of this gland. Thyroid gland regulates
the metabolic process of tissues by releasing thyroixine
hormone. Along with growth hormone, Thyroxine is
helpful in the development of the brain. Low secretion of
thyroxine hormone disrupts the growth of body and more
secretion leads to hyperthyroid disease. Apart from this,
increase in the size of this gland also leads to a disease
called Goitre. This disease is caused by iodine
deficiency.

Parathyroid Gland :

These glands are attached to the thyroid gland.
Its' size is of pea granule and these are four in numbers.
These glands release para hormone which
regulates the distribution and metabolic processes of
calcium and phosphorus in the body. The bones become
porous and weak due to excess secretion of this
hormone and stone forms in the kidneys. Deficiency of
the para hormone causes calcium deficiency and the
disease tetanus which is cured with calcium rich
medication.
