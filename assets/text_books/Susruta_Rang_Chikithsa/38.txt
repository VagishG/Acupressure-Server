Adrenal Gland :

These two glands are located above both the kidneys.
Each gland is composed of two different parts cortex
and medulla. Different hormones are secreted from them.
Mineralo corticoids and gluco corticoids and sex
hormones are secreted from cortex.

Different corticosteroids prevent body's mineral salts
such as sodium, potassium from being expelled from
the body. So they increase the quantity of water in
tissues. Glycocorticoids are also esential for the
metabolic process of carbohydrates. The blood pressure
increases due to more steroids in the body. And due to
damage of lymphatic tissue, resistance to body
infections decreases.

Androgen is secreted in men and estrogen in women
under sex hormones. Their effect is similar to that of
testes and ovary secreted hormones. Addison's disease
is due to deficiency of it and Cushing's syndrome is due
to excess of it.
