CHAPTER -5
Metaphysical Treatment on Points

Meridian Introduction :

Chinese philosophers have termed the path of the flow
of bio-energy in the body as Meridians.

Chief Features of Meridians :

1.

Every Meridian is related to each energyâ€™s related
yin-yang body organ.

There are mainly 12 meridians that belong to Liver,
Gail Bladder, Heart, Small Intestine, Brain, Spinal
Cord, Spleen, Stomach, Lungs, Large Intestine and
Urinary Bladder.

According to Chinese philosophers, imbalance in
the body is termed as sickness or unhealthiness.

The disease is transmitted in the body through the
meridians and also from them the disease goes out
of the body.

In this way, diseases can be treated by various
points present on the meridians which we call
Acupoint. We can use pressure colour or
acupuncture on various points present on meridian
to treat disease. (In this book only treatment through
colour is given).
