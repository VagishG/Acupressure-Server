Under 12 meridians, the controlling meridians of
yin & yang of our body is CV & GV.

There are approximately 360 points on all these
meridians, in which 5-5 points of each meridian
relating to five element are of special importance
which are named as Shu-points by Chinese
philosophers.

In this way, these are kept in the order of wind, fire,
humidity, dryness & coldness starting with wind on
each meridians.

At these important points, energy balance is
established by the colours (according to table given
on next page) in different parts of the body by
reducing (Sedation) or increasing (tonification)
energy.

Treatment of different diseases are done by various
points from the Shu points present on meridian.

Koreaâ€™s great philosopher and scientist Prof. Park has

set the whole body analogy on the palm of hand & on the
soles of foot. Accordingly, plotting of all the Chinese
Meridians have been done on palm & soles of feet, which
they have called the Byol Meridians. From the point of view
of treatment, the points present on these meridians will be
used.
