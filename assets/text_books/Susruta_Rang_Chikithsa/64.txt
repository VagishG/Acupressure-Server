A)

Estimate nature based on the occupation adopted
by the patient.

Estimate the nature of the disease according to the

time of arriving, progression & decrease of disease.

Determining nature by estimating the state of the
energy flowering in the energy paths is a defectless
& reliable method. The following methods are
adopted primarily to estimate.

Through the use of Byol Magnet :

In this method, the Byol magnets are used
according to its energy flow in the Byol meridian to
increase or decrease the energy flow. To increase
the energy flow of the energy path, apply the white
magnet (north pole) on the first joint in the direction
of flow & yellow magnet (south pole) on the other
joint. To reduce the energy flow, the position of
keeping magnet is changed i.e. the yellow magnet
(South Pole) is placed at the first joint of the flow &
the white magnet (North Pole) is placed at the other
joint on fingers on byol meridians.
