Through the use of Fingers :

The tips of our fingers are made with magnetic
properties by nature. Each finger of each hand has
either the effect of the Southern pole or the effect
of the North pole. This magnetic effect of fingers is
used to increase or decrease energy flow like byol
magnets.

With the help of probe :

Probe (Small rod like diagnostics tool made of solid
metal) is used to increase or decrease energy on
the energy path. In this, a certain point is used on
each energy path.

This point is the basic energy point of that energy
path. At this point, a pressure is applied keeping
the probe obliquely towards the flow of energy or
on the opposite side. If the pressure is given
towards the flow of energy then the energy flow
increases on the energy path. If the pressure on
the point is given in the opposite direction of the
energy flow path then the energy flow decreases
in the energy path. In this way, the disease is
diagnosed by increasing or decreasing the flow of
energy in the energy path.
