Original energy point of subjugator organ.

Energy point of Brain/Tw (master) energy path
using the basic energy point of the original energy
path.

Energy point of CV/Gv (Control) energy path using
the basic energy point of the original energy path.

The core energy of the organ, the core energy of son or
mother & the energy point of the energy path which is the
primary energy point of the original energy path is chosen.
We can understand this well through an example if we have
to increase (tonify) the humidity of the spleen then we choose
the energy points & paths given below :

1.

Increase the flow in humidity point of Spleen (yellow
col. on sp 3).

Decrease the flow of original energy wind of its
subjugator organ (Liver-Brown Col on Liv 1).

Brown Col. On Lungsâ€™ original point Lu8 which is
subjugator organ of subjugator organ Liver.

Yellow colour on P7 to increase the flow of humidity
in Pericardium.

Yellow colour on Humidity point of CV to increase
the humidity in conception vessel.
