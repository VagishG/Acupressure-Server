What is Acupressure?

Acupuncture is a natural science, philosophy and a rational method of therapy based

given by acupressure / acupuncture or moxibation at defined locations in the human body
which are called Acupoints or Shu-Xue-Points.

Shu means move, transfer, transmit, transport or induce the bio energy (Qi) and the
body fluids (Xue) and it includes supplying of bio energy at the location where these are
deficient from the location where these are in excess in the human body, thereby balancing
the energy and fluids. It includes removing the stasis, unfastening the impediments and
occlusions and correcting the contravections and flexures, all with the help of:

(a) Four Diagnosis

(b) Eight Guiding Criteria

(c) Six Excesses

(d) Seven Emotions

The basis of treatment is “Five Element Theory”

Qiis the vital energy or bio energy or ki or chi or prana, which runs in the human body
and the whole cosmos.

The body fluids (Xue) include water, blood, lymph, cerebro spinal fluid, sweat, stool,
urine, air, saliva, sperm, ova, hormones, chemicals, synovial fluids, tears, ear wax, breast
milk, mucous, phlegm etc.

Bio-Energy:

Bio-energy (Qi) is received in the human body in two ways:-

First, the earthly energy which is received by way of food, drinks, air etc.

Second, the heavenly energy (Stems) which is received from cosmos. The heavenly
stems are received in the human body constantly through various acupuncture points from
time to time, which forms the base of the time acupuncture.
