Law of Xi-Cleft Points
or
Accumulating Points (Hung)

Each of the twelve paired meridians has an acupoint called Xi Cleft point or
Accumulating Point, which treats acute and chronic diseases of the meridian as well as the
concerned internal organ. Apart from this some extraordinary vessels also have Xi Cleft
points, which treat acute as well as chronic problems relating to the concerned vessel.

In China Great Buddha’s Temples are called as “HUNG”. In the same manner Xi-Cleft
points are also known as a temple in the human body. Xi-Cleft points are “gaps in the body
where Qi and blood converge and collect”

When the flow of the bio energy gets interrupted in the body because of congestion in
the energy, then this energy gets accumulated on the Xi-Cleft points. So, treatment on xi-
cleft points affects the circulation of the bio energy very deep. It treats chronic and very old
diseases as well as it also treats intense acute disorders. For the treatment of deep routed
serious diseases first related points are to be treated and then treatment on xi-cleft should
be given. It stops the recurrence of the disease.
