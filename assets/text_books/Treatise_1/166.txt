Law of Alarm Points
(Front Shu & Back Shu Points)

In our body in the front on chest and stomach and on the back part there are few points
on which there will be too much of pain while mere touching or giving pressure. Here the
color of the skin also starts changing. These points are known as Alarm Points. This only
happens when there is any disease or deformity in the related organ. Then these alarm
points give information of that diseased organ in the form of an alarm.

Allthose Alarm points, which are located on chest and stomach, are Mu front Points or
.Mu Front Shu Points. They are 12 in numbers and related to the 12 different organs of the

body.

All those Alarm points which are located on the back are known as Back Shu Points.
They are also 12 in numbers and related to 12 different organs of the body.

Treatment on these alarm points does three activities simultaneously :

a) Diagnosis of Disease

b) Prognosis of Disease

c) Cureof Disease
By giving treatment on these points congested and overactive organs can be treated
but as well as moxa on these points or magnet treatment or electric current treatment can
balance the underactive organs.
