Example 2- A 7 years old girl had a problem; her front
new tooth started growing while old tooth was intact.
Doctor advised to operate the old tooth, but by chance,
her index finger got pressed in door at location of Li 1.
Thereafter, her old tooth came out by itself.

If a patientâ€™s pupil is a bit above and the white portion
of the lower side is visible, then this is the case of
Yin Sampanku. It denotes problem of testicles in
males and ovaries in females St 1 is at the lower
side of the eye, so treatment on St45 cures the
problems of testicles and ovaries.

\f outer side of nail in the thumb of leg, is getting darker
so the disease is at Sp1 and treatment would be at
Sp21. Acute pain around Sp21 can be cured by
treating Sp1.

Knot, swelling, redness on axilla around H1 would
be treated by H9.

Si 19 is located near to eardrum so for any diseases
related of eardrum Si19 should also be treated.

UB1 is located on the inner sides of the eyes. Tear
duct is also located here. So on the
closure of tear duct treat UB67. In many cases
treatment on UB67 releases tear duct.

For example : One patient had come for the
treatment of eye ulcer at Allahabad Centre. The ulcer
was near to UB1 only. Pressure on UB67 cured that
ulcer surprisingly.
