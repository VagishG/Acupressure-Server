Law of Four Needle Treatment

(According to Five Elements, Ten Stems Written by Kiko Matsumoto)

Kiko Matsumoto in her literature on the subject has suggested to follow the

following treatment procedure:
In Deficiencies :

1.

Tonify the deficient meridian at its mother point. For example: in the case of
deficiency of lungs, tonify the earth point of lungs meridian ie. Lu9.

Tonify the horary point of the mother element. !n the case of deficiency of lungs
tonify the horary point of mother ie Sp3.

Disperse or sedate the controller element point on the affected meridian. In this
case controller of metal is fire. Hence sedate fire point of lungs ie. Lu10.
Disperse or sedate the horary point (element point) of the controller element. In
this case controller element is fire. As heart is controller of lungs, sedate fire point
of heart ie. H8.

In the nutshell we can say, if energy is less and deficient in any organ, then:

1.

2.

First do the tonification with two needles :
(a) Tonify the mother element point of that affected meridian, in which the
deficiency is there.

(b) Tonify the horary point of that meridian’s mother element meridian, in which
the deficiency is there.

Then, do the sedation with two needles :
(a) sedate the controller element point of that meridian, in which the deficiency
is there.

(b) Forthe deficient meridian, sedate the hcrary point (element point) of that
meridian’s controller element's meridian.

In this way do the treatment with four needles or four magnets (two south pole and two
north pole) on byo! meridians. The same four needle treatment can be done with color on
the four points.
