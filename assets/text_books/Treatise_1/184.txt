Law of Root and Fruit

Sometimes it is seen that disease reflects in the form of boils, pimples, pain, tumor,
burning sensation, wound, spot, skin disease etc. at one part of the body but the root of that
disease is at other part of the body. In this case, treatment on related points of root disease
can cure the disease amazingly.

There is a table understated. In the table it is shown that disease is on the head or

disease lies. This is called Referred Pain & Disease.
