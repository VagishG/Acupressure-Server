In China, husband organs are known as Yin and Wife organs are yang. Even husband
organs can be named as solid organs. They are : Heart, Spleen, Lungs, Kidney and Liver.
The functioning of these organs in human body is continuous from birth to death and when
they stop to work, the human dies. For example: Heart- The time when we came to this
world, our heart started palpitating and from that time onwards it keeps on pulsating and the
time it will stop pulsating, we will be declared as dead. That means heart is an organ which
functions continuously twenty four hours daily from birth to death.

Wife organs can also be named as Hollow Organs. They are- Stomach, Large
Intestine, Small Intestine, Urinary Bladder and Gall Bladder. These wife organs work only
when the work comes and rest of the time, they relax. For example: when we take food that
goes for digestion in our stomach. Stomach generally takes four hours to digest that food
and then sends it to small intestine and stomach relaxes after that. Again, when we have
food, stomach starts working. On the fasting day, stomach relaxes for the whole day. That
means these wife organs work, when there is some work to do, otherwise they relax.
