Vessel
Relationship

In congenital and chronic diseases, treat Master and Coupled points of both the friend
meridians. For example, If moustaches and beard grows in a lady, it shows a chronic
hormonal problem; the treatment would be on the Master and Coupled pointâ€™s Ren Mo and

Chong Mo. Treatment points are: Lu7,K 6, Sp 4,P6
Second Treatment Technique :

1. First treat the master point. This will correct yin-yang equilibrium.
2. _ If there is no total relief, then also treat coupled point.
3. Even then, if the required result is not achieved, then treat the points of opposite

sign of conception vessel and Governing Vessel.

Examples :
It is a example for the case of obsessions:

1. Treat UB 62 of both sides. It would give a little relief.
2. Then, treat Si 3 of both the sides. It would give a little more relief.
3. Then after that treat Lu7 (Master point of Conception Vessel Meridian). It would

give the full relief
