Four Needle

In excesses :

1.

Sedate the affected meridian at its child element point. In the case of lungs excess,
sedate the water point (child) of Lungsi.e. Lu5.

Sedate the horary point (element point) of child meridian. In this case kidney is
the child of lung. Hence sedate the horary point (water point) of Kidney ie. K 10.

Tonify the affected meridian at the controller element point. In this case controller
of metal is fire. So tonify fire point of Lungs at Lu 10.

Tonify the controller meridian at its horary point (element point). In this case
controller of lungs is heart. So tonify the fire point of heart ie. H8

In the nutshell if the energy is in excess in any meridian:

First do the sedation with two needles;

(a) Sedate the affected meridian at its child element point.

(b) Sedate the child meridian at its horary point (element point)

Then do the tonification with two needles:

(a) Tonify the affected meridian at its controller element point.

(b) Tonify the controller meridian at its horary point (own element point).

Above stated four needle treatment is very effective. So, if the energy is too deficient
or in too excess in meridian and our diagnosis and symptoms of disease is very abusive,
then only use this four needles treatment. If the energy is not much imbalanced, then treat
with the first needle point only. If the imbalance is a little more then use two needle. But in
the case of too much of imbalance, use four needles.

In Excess Conditions :

a) Select more distal points

b) Useless local points.

c) Sedate the distal points.

d) Apply neutral technique to the local points.
Rational :

i)
il)

Distal points are the main points to calm hyperactivity of a meridian.
Local points are selected to direct calming action of the distal points.
