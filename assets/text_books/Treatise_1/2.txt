Bio- Energy is of two types :

4)
2)
1)

2)

Superficial Bio-energy
Deep Bio-energy
Superficial Bio- energy works mainly in the superficial parts i.e. not in depth of
human body. Organ clock is the base of movement of energy. Superficial energy
moves from Lung to Large Intestine > Stomach > Spleen —> Heart > Small
intestine — Urinary Bladder ® Kidney > Pericardium —> Triple Warmer > Gall
Bladder — Liver > Lungs. Hence Lung is mother of Large Intestine and Large
Intestine is mother of Stomach and so on.
Deep Bio-energy works mainly in the internal parts of the human body. The deep
Bio-energy works as per “Five Element Theory”.
For example:
Liver is the mother of Heart. Hence, if there is deficiency of energy in the Heart, in
deep routed energy problems, tonification/sedation etc. of Liver is done as per
“Five Element Theory”.
