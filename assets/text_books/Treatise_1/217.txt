Treat The Windows of the Sky in Acute &
Emergency Like Conditions

“All the energies yang come from the yin, for the yin is earth. This yang energy always
climbs from the lower part of the body towards the head, but if it is interrupted in its course,
it cannot climb beyond the abdomen. In that case one must find which meridian is diseased.
One must tonify the yin (as it creates the yang) and disperse the yang so that energy is
attracted towards the top of the body and the circulation is reestablished.” — Nei Jing

In our body the flow of the bio energy is from downwards to upwards and interruption
in this system disturbs the circulation system in the body. It results in different kinds of
sudden acute diseases. For the regulation of the circulation system in the body, points for
