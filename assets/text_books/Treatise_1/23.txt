Treatment Planning

Note :-

Advance acupressure laws are also Adcupuncture laws.

The acupoints may be treated either by acupressure or by acupuncture or by applying
seeds, color, star or byol magnets.

Disease can be treated in two ways: |
1. By Chinese System
2. By Western Allopathy System

There is no alternative for Chinese Energy System. This therapy is very well self
sufficient in treating diseases. The need is to understand the Chinese energy system, the
five element theory and the treatment for the same accordingly.

With the experience of centuries, following combinations of acupuncture points are
very effective :

1. Treatment on local & distal points

Treatment on both sides of the body

Treatment on the other side of the body (Disease here- Treatment there)
Treatment on lower & upper points of the body

Treatment on related points for disease + Shu Stream points
Treatment on external disease point + internal disease point

Treatment on combination of abdominal & dorsal points
