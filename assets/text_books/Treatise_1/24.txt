Treatment on Local + Distal Points :

In this two types of points are used :

i) Local Points

ii) Distal Points

Treament on distal points is to be given first. This would give a little relief. To get

even more relief, treatment on local points is to be given then. This is observed with

experience that this kind of treatment would give more and fast relief. Five shu points

are also distal points.

Rational is that Qi is propelled towards the site of affection to treat the disease. In

case of intense pain, swelling, tension affecting the periphery of members, stimulate

points near the site of disease. Treat CV3,4 for micturation, hoarseness, headache,

abdominal pain, pain in the centre of the body, piles etc. points nearitne site improves

the trouble but the distal points treat it.

Treatment on both side of The Body :

When the disease is internal and organ is also affected then bilateral treatment would

give better relief.

Forexample : â€” Forchronic indigestion treatment should be given on St36 on both
legs simultaneously.

Treatment on the other side of The Body :

(Disease here - Treatment here)

In this type, treatment is to be given to the opposite side of the disease. For

example :

i) In paresis and paralysis treatment is to be given on the opposite side of the
diseased area.

ii) Evenin sciatica, treatment should be given on the opposite side.
Treatment on Upper and Lower Points of The Body :

Points above the diaphragm and points of upper extremities are known as upper points
and points below the diaphragm and points of lower extremities are known as lower

points.
