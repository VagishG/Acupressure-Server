When disease is not located at one place then treatment would be on related points to
that disease and with this combination of upper and lower points propels energy(Qi)
towards the related points of the disease. In this upper + lower points work as
complimentary points.

For Example :

â€˜At the time of treatment of Eight Extra Ordinary vessels, along with the Master points,
coupled points are also treated and with coupled points, master points are also treated.
These both kind of points are located on the upper and lower part of the body and they
are complimentary to each other.

Treatment on Disease Related Points + Shu Stream Points :

When there is any blockage in any body organ or in organ vessel and flow of energy &
other types of flows get interrupted then it reflects as Rheumatic pain on the joints of
hand & feet. On which joint is the rheumatic pain and because of this which organ is
blocked, is the art of diagnosing involved in basic knowledge of Chinese Acupuncture.
Like cramp in the toe of the foot etc shows a blockage in liver and for this treat Liv3
(Shu Stream point). For the blockage of arteries of heart treat P7 and Lu9. This reflects
as wrist pain.
Treatment on disease related points, any one or more than one Shu Stream points
(Liv3, P7, H7, K3, Sp3, Lu9, GB41, TW3, UB65, Si3, St43, Li3) gives immense relief.
| have seen through my experience that 12 Shu Stream points are like 12 precious
stones. Even sometimes very old and chronic disease gets cured by the treatment on
only one point.
Treatment on External Disease Points + Internal Disease Points :
It is a combination of points related to external and points related to internal.
a) Yinisinternal
b) Yangis external
c) Yinand Yang meridian meets and communicates at Luo Connecting Points.

In this antagonistic formula is to be used.

In this tonification of Organ Source Point of one meridian is to be given and with
this tonification of Luo Connecting Point of Partner meridian is also to be done.
