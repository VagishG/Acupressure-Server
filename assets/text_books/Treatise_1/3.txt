Fire melts metal, so fire is the controller of metal.

Metallic saw cuts tree so metal is controller of wood.

Earth dams the water so earth is controller of water.

In this, the relationship between these five elements is shown in the figure 2.

1. Water controls fire so Kidney and Urinary Bladder control Heart and small Intestine.
2. Wood covers the earth so Liver and Gall Bladder control the spleen and Stomach.

3. Fire melts the metal so heart and small intestine control the Lungs and Large
Intestine.

4. Earth dams the water so Spleen and Stomach control the Kidney and the Urinary
Bladder.

5. Asaw made of metal cuts the tree so Lungs and Large Intestine controls the
Liver and Gall Bladder

Three Types of Diseases :

There can be three types of diseases in human beings :
1. Acute hyper disease

2. Chronic hyper disease

3. Sub-Acute disease

Treatment of Acute Hyper Disease :

The meaning of acute disease is a type of disease that occurs suddenly or itâ€™s been
there for a few days only. It was not there before. This type of disease immediately
takes the form of hyper or very strong disease and creates a troublesome situation. In
fact in this type of disease the secretion of bio energy increases more than enough to
the organ related to that particular disease, this is known as hyper active condition. In
this kind, the bio energy of that organ is to be sedated, known as sedation of organ.
Points of Sedation:

(Refer figure 3)

In every meridian there is one specific sedation point which is its Son Point. Treatment
on this son point related to that meridian transfers energy to son organ. In this way the
excess energy gets controlled.
