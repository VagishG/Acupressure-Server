The Back-Shu points are a group of points displaying a segmental arrangement. They form a fairly
accurate surface making of the outflow of the sympathetic ganglia to their respective pertaining organs.
The Back-Shu points are an interesting example of a holistic meeting point of the chiropracter, osteopath,
neurophysiologist, the anatomist and the traditional acupuncturist.
