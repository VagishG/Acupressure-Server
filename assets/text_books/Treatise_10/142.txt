Dr. Wang, the most respected Chinese acupuncturist of the 20th century, was of the
opinion that almost all the cases of dysmenorrhea are caused by emotions being
unfulfilled or unsatisfied and the main pattern associated with it was liver Qi stagnation
causing depression. Dr. Wang was also of the opinion that each and every case
of dysmenorrhea is accompanied by one major mental or emotional symptom
and one major physical symptom of pain or distension in a particular part of the
body apart from discomfort or pain in the peivic area.
