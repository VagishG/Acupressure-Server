Hence, quantity of air inhaled and exhaled per minute varies directly with the level of
activity.

More activity, needs more air
Less activity needs less air
Q Breathing Process :
i) Air is inhaled through nose or mouth where larger impurities in air are filtered.
ii) Further the air moves through trachea (wind pipe), which is of a thumb's width.
Trachea (aia “cit) is a wind pipe which takes air from nose to bronchi.
iii) | From trachea, the air goes to smaller pipes called bronchi (gareHfermre)

Bronchi (garaferre) are division of air tubes which goes from wind pipe
(trachea) to lungs.

iv) From bronchi the air goes to even smaller tubes called bronchioles
(qerearerafersre) |

v) From bronchioles the air goes to alveolis. Alveolies are network of lacs of
microscopic air sacs (arepiferat) |
