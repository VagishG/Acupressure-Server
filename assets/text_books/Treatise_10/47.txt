Alveolis Ud Yet <b Aferow capillaries ura-URT eit #1 Here, oxygen passes
through the alveolis to the blood vessels (capillaries). In exchange the Co, leaves
the blood & goes to alveoli.

The O, rich blood travels to the left side of heart via pulmonary vein for distribu
tion in the whole body.

Q_ Breathing sae :

Breathing includes inhalation & exhalation.
Inhalation means taking O, into the lungs.
Exhalation means expelling CO, through the air ways.

Inhalation : It is active process.

Signals from brain stimulate the diaphragm. Signals from brain contract the inspira-
tory muscles. When the main muscle of the breathing, the diaphragm contracts. It
descends towards the abdomen & pulls more O, rich air through the airways into lungs.

Exhalation : It is passive process.

When one exhales, the diaphragm & inspiratory muscle relax and air is compressed
in the lungs and is expelled. The elastic recoil of the lungs pulls the lungs to their initial size.
If there is too much Co, in the blood, the brain signals the lungs to breath more often & more

deeply.

The air inhaled contains dust, dirt, smoke, bacterias, infection & other
substances.

Nose & lungs filter out these inpurites in the air inhaled.

The lining of the bronchial tree has glands, which produces mucous. Mucous is
a thick liquid that traps particles.

There are tiny hairs in the lining of tubes of bronchial tree. These hairs are
called cilia (Je). It beats upwards towards mouth gaa ait sH dust particle 3nf&
