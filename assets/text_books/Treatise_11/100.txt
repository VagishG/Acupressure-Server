2) Since the heart beat is often rapid than normal, the heart pumps blood less
effectively.

3) _ Inatrial fibrillation, blood can pool in the atria, forming clots. These clots can
travel from the heart and lodge in any artery in any other part of the body.
If any of these clots blocks a vessel in the brain, it can cause a stroke. A
stroke occurs when the blood flow to the brain is disrupted because a vessel
supply it has either ruptured or is blocked. Deprived of blood and oxygen
brain cells and brain tissue die and are not replaced. As a result of such
stroke, the parts of the body controlld by those cells can loss their ability to
function. A stroke can cause a loss of function which is often permanent.
Atrial fibrillation causes about 15% of all strokes.

c) Atrial Flatter:

Itis another type of rhythm disturbance related to atrial chambers. As compared

to atrial fibrillation, the contraction of the atria are more regular but they are still

inefficient in sending blood from the atria to the ventricles.

In this case the heart can be forced to beat at a dangeriously fast rate.

Atrial fibrillation & atrial flutter are two different types of disorders. If someone has
atrial flutter, he can develop atrial fibrillation later & thus suffer from both types of
disorders. Both have to be treated.

How to detect the disease ?

Anelectrocardiogram can detect an abnormal rhythm of atria. ifthe rhythm comes
and goes, a 24 hours ECG monitering heat rhythm may be needed.

Abnormally rapid heart rate usually 160 to 220 per minute is called tachycardia.
