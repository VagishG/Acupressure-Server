High Blood Pressure :

H. B. P. orhypertension, is a condition in which the pressure of blood in the arteries is
too high.

H. B. P. with no symptoms is silent killer.

Blood pressure goes up when the heart pumps blood with more pressure (force).
Blood pressure goes up when the arterioles narrow causing more resistance to the
circulating blood.

If tube of toothpaste's opening is okay the paste comes out easily with slight pressure.
But when same opening narrows down then extra pressure is required.

Heart rate increases during exercise and it exherts more pressure at every beat so
the blood pressure also increases but treatment is not required in such a case.
Brain controls the blood pressure through autonomic nervous system.

During excercise the arterioles and muscles of the heart and Lungs widen to
accomodate extra blood flow.

Hypothalamus cuts down the blood supply of skin, stomach and intestine through the
sympathetic nerves and increases that of heart and lungs.

Adrenal glands get stimulated through sympathetic nerves and secrete aÂ¢renaline
(steroid).

Sympathetic nerve indicates the heart to pump out blood with more force.

It also broadens the branchioles of Lungs so that more air gets accomodated.

When excercising ceases the parasympathetic nerve indicates the pace maker-
sinoatrial node to slower down the heart rate. When excercising commences the
parasympathetic nerve stops signaling and sympathetic nerve again increases the
heart beat and blood pressure.

Life Style changes to prevent and treat High Blood Pressure :
Have enough of green vegetables and fruits.

Have potassium rich foods.
