Pulmonary Encephalopathy Causing Respiratory
& Cardiac Failure

Chronic bronchitis causes pulmonary emphysema and ultimately causes pulmonary
heart disease.

This is a dangerous stage as it can be fatal and mortality rate is also high. Chinese
acupuncture can be very helpful in such cases.

In this case heart rate increases with an irregular cardiac rhythm and rapid breathing.
Sometimes liver gets enlarged with respiratory acidosis & metabolic alkalosis. The patient
is treated with antibiotics, diuretics, cardiac stimulants, respiratory stimulants and put on
oxygen. The symptoms are fever, wheezing, blackish face. Frothy sputum, breathing through
mouth. Cold limbs, fits, incontinence etc.

The patient may slip into coma.

Acupuncture along with allopathic treatment may be very useful.

Pulmonary Emphysema:

In pulmonary emphysema there is distention of the pulmonary alveoli due to
accumulation of air.

TCM Pathogenesis :

i) _ Lungs, Heart and Kidney are deficient.

ii) There is acumulation of phlegm and fluid in Lungs.

iii) There is upward attack on Heart and Lungs.

iv) There is stasis of Heart Blood.

v) The pulmonary function of dispersing and descending is slowed down.
vi) Due to deficient kidney, the inhalation function is weak.

vil) The patient may go in coma.

Accordingt to Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, respiratory and cardiac failure are of
two types due to pulmonary encephalopathy :

1) Retention of water due to yang deficiency
2) Exhaustion of real yin and Qi
