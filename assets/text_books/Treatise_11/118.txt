Pulmonary Hypertension (Cor Pulmonale)

The heart's right pumping chamber (right ventricle) becomes dilated and weak.

The right ventricle is unable to send blood fully and effectively into Lungs. The left
ventrical remains normal.

Cor pulmonale is caused by chronic Lungs disease like chronic bronchitis and
emphysema.

High blood pressure in the arteries of Lungs causes cor pulmonale. in the long run
emphysema or chronic bronchitis destroys the small air sacs and blood vessels in the
Lungs. it makes it difficult for oxygen to get into blood.

Lower blood oxygen levels cause the arteries in the Lungs to clamp down.

Itraises pressure in the pulmonary arteries.

Itis called pulmonary hypertension. Hence the right ventricle has to work harder to
pump blood against the increased pressure.

Another cause of pulmonary hypertension may be blood clots that struck in the blood
vessels of the Lungs.

In young women sometimes the pulmonary hypertension is caused due to unknown
reasons. Pulmonary hypertension is sometimes caused by drugs like fenfluramine and
dexfenfluramine.

Symptoms:

When hearts's right ventricle fails, the blood returns into the veins. This increases the
pressure in the veins and the fluids starts getting out and into the tissues. This causes
swelling in legs. Afterwards liver starts swelling and scars start to appear. It is called liver
cirrhosis. At this stage abdominal fluids start getting into the peritoneal cavity giving rise to
ascites bulky and swollen abdomen.

An echocardiogram can give clear report on the functioning of right ventricle.

Remember the following while treating pulmonary hypertension :

1) Open the airways , Alveolis, bronchis bronchioles & re establish their resilency.

2) Reduce inflammation on lungs.
