Q00

When Truth appears Nice

True words don't seem nice Intelligent is not knowledgeable
Nice words don't seem true Knowledgeable is not intelligent
Decent don't argue Holy people do not accumulate
Arguing people are not decent Giving is their duty.

One who gives more Oi

ne who serves but does not complain,
That receives more That takes the path of heaven.

One who serves and gives wounds As aperson does

Those take the path of this world So he gets results.

Lo

I don't want to become intelligent When truth appears nice
T don't want to become knowledgeable And when nice appears true

I want to become a decent person Whole world appears nice
Like a holy saint, devoid of pride. Nice appears whole world.

You see Shiva in all

They see Shiva in you

Your journey is over then
Though you appear traveling
