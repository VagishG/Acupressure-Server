Cardiomegaly is enlarged of heart.

The heart has to work more in case of chronic High B.P. the left ventricle becomes
fatty and the heart becomes weak. Eventually it may lead to heart failure.

Similarly the muscles of the heart also thicken, when it has to work more. The heart thus
becomes weak which eventually may lead to heart failure. An X-ray reports about the size
