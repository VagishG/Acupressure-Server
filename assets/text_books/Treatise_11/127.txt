Stress Causes Heart Diseases

The body does not differentiate between physical danger and psychological stress.

Both produce the same response.

Epinephrine and norepinephrine hormones are released.

These hormones cause the heart to beat faster and pump harder, increasing its demand

for oxygen.

They constrict the arteries.

They raise the blood pressure.

In chronic cases the B.P. remains high all the time damaging inner lining of the arteries.

It further causes atherosclerosis, where the platelets start collecting. It becomes a

tisk factor for a heart attack.

Whenever an enemy strikes our sympathetic nervous system prepare us for a flight

or flight response. The brain messages adrenal gland which produce epinephrine or

norepinephrine for the former or latter type of response. The sympathetic nervous

system acts in the same way in cases of anger, fear or excitement.

Epinephrine or norepinephrine are slower and short run active hormone.

Cartisol is longer acting hormone and is secreted by the adrenal glands.

1) Cortison helps sustain prolonged stress.

2) Elevated blood glucose damages the arteries. Cortisol helps body convert fats
and protein into glucose.

3) Excess fat in body hampers the blood flow. Cortisol helps mobilise fatty acids
from fatty tissue and adipose tissues.

4) _ Insulin resistance is a very significant risk factor for heart disease. Cortisol makes
cells less senstive to insulin.
i) Cortisol levels follow a natural rhythm peaking in the morning when we get

up, reaching lower level in the evening just before we sleep or just after we
falla sleep.
