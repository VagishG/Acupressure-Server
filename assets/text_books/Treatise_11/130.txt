If the collateral win then heart attack can be avoided.

Regular exercise increases number of collaterals.

Exercise decreases Blood Pressure :

Improvement in blood flow due to regular exercise results in lower resistance on the
arteries and thus lower the blood pressure.

Exercise improves insulin resistance :

Insulin resistance is a very significant factor for heart disease.

Exercise enables cells to extract glucose from the blood, even in the absence of
Insulin.

It does so by producing special protein called GLUT 4.

Glut 4 goes to the surface of the cell and allow the glucose to go into the cells. By this
process blood sugar is lowered.

In the long run exercises improve insulin sensitivity. Regular exercise goes on
increasing the numbers of GLUT 4 transporters. Thus the ability of cells to properly
utilise insulin increases.

Loss of abdominal fat is important to prevent and control insulin resistance.
Exercise causes weight loss :

Excess weight is another risk factor for heart disease.

Itis impossible to maintain regular weight without exercise.

If one eats more calories than one burn, one will gain weight.

The best way to burn more calories is to exercise.

Ultimately the resting metabolism rate also decreases. This means that more
calories will be used even when one is not exercising. It further helps in controlling
weight.
