Abnormalities in Heart Valves

Aortic valve stneosis and insufficiency.

a) Aortic viaveis a valve between left ventricle and aorta.

b) Aortic valve is composed of three leaf lets.

c) Oxygen rich blood is supplied to the aorta via the aortic viave.

d) The aortic valve ensures that the blood does not back flow to the left ventricle.
Aortic Stenosis (AS. or AVS) :

When the aortic valve becomes stiff and its opening becomes narrow, it is called
aortic stenosis.

a) Some patients have a congenital problem. There aortic valves have only two
leaflets instead of three. This may not cause any trouble in childhood but later on
the leaflets become stiff thus the aortic valve fails to open up properly.

b) The cause of aortic stenosis may be due to aortic degeneration, in later life.
c) Rheumatic fever may cause aortic stenosis.
In aortic stenosis, more and more scar tissues build up on the valve.

The valve does not open completely and the left ventricle has to make more effort
to thrust the blood into the aorta as it faces resistance from the valve. This may the
aortic valve also has to make more effort . all of these thickness the muscles of left
ventricle.

Aortic insufficiency or Aortic Regurgitation or Aortic Incompetence (AR or Al):
This is condition in which the aortic valve does not close completely.

The blood leaks back into left ventricle from the aorta during relaxed (diastolic) phase
ofthe heart contraction.

Causes of Al/ AR:

i) | Rheumatic fever

ii) Infectious endocarditis

ili) Abacterial infection of the heart valve
