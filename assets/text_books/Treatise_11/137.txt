iv) Dilation of aorta also causes the aortic valve insufficiency
This is called aneurysm of aorta.
Itis also known as manfan's syndrome.

v) Connective tissue disease such as lupus rheumatoid arthritis.

Initially aortic insufficiency remains undetected, after a couple of years, it causes
breathlessness, palpitation & heaviness in head.

These symptoms are seen when A.I. occurs due to aortic aneurysm or some bacterial
infection. If aortic valve is too small the blood does not reach the brain & it may result
in fainting. The patient may suffer from fits of fainting which requires attention as it may
be fatal if not attended.

Aortic incompetence causes back flow of blood which further dilates the left ventricle.
Ultimately the heart muscles become very weak causing breathlessness and symptoms
of heart failure appear.

There is severe pain in chest with heavy sweating.

Acute aortic insufficiency causes congestive heart failure.

Diagnosis :

i) Aortic stenosis (AR) or aortic insufficient(Al) is not easy to detect but doctors
can understand with the help of their stethoscope .

ii) Anultrasound or echocardiogram also confirm AR or Al.

Stenosis of aortic valves are two types :

1) Severe aortic stenosis

2) Mild aortic stenosis

Severe aortic stenosis (severe AS) :

When aortic valve gets stiff with a narrow opening due to excessive constriction it

causes severe aortic stenosis.

Sometimes only an echocardiogram detects it, as there are no symptoms.

i) _ Itis treated by valve replacement.

ii) Angioplasty can be carried out to dilate the valve but that is not a permanent
solution.
