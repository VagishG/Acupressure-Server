Mild Aortic Stenosis (Mild A.S.) :

Mild constriction, stiffness or narrowing of aortic valve is called mild aortic stenosis.
Doctors try to reduce blood pressure with medication so that there is no back flow into
the left ventricle.

In chronic cases left ventricle gets enlarged. The muscles become very weak causing
acute aortic insufficiency. Surgery has to be carried out in an emergency as the patient
faints frequently. Either the valve is replaced or balooning is done to dilate the valve.

Mitral Stenosis & Insufficiency (M.S. & M.L.) :

1) Mitral valve connects left atrium to left ventricle.

2) It sends oxygenated blood coming from the lungs to left ventricle.

Mitral Stenosis (M. S.) :

Stiffening and narrowing of the mitral valve is called mitral stenosis.

Cause of mitral stenosis :

1) Rheumatic fever is the common cause of mitral stenosis.
Ultimately the left atrium dilates and the blood goes back to Lungs.

2) _Inwomen in some cases symptom of mitral stenosis appear during pregnancy
due to extra work load on heart.

Mitral stenosis develops slowly.

For many year, no symptoms appear.

Mitral Insufficiency or Mitral Regurgitation or Mitral Incompetence (MI or MR) :

Itis caused by deformity in the shape of the mitral valve.

The left ventricle contracts to thrust the oxygenated blood into the aorta. But because

of M.S. or M.I. the blood goes back to left atrium and this is called mitral insufficiency

or mitral regurgitation.

Causes of diseases :

1) Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of M. S. and consequently M. R.

2) Congestive heart failure also causes the left atrium and left ventricle to stretch. It
widens the mitral valve which causes the blood to go back to left atrium from left
ventricle.
