This is very serious situation.
Symptoms:
i)  Inmitral stenosis, there are no symptoms for many years.

ii) _ Inthe long run, congestive heart failure may occur. When the blood goes back to
the lungs, the congestive heart failure occurs breathlessness while working and
resting both. White forthy or bloody phlegm comes out of mouth..

Severe Mitral Stenosis :

When the mitral stenosis is severe it causes :

High pressure in the left atrium.

\tleads to stretching and enlargement of left atrium.

This may ultimately cause left atrium fibrillation. In fibrillation the heart rhythm disturbs,

The left atrium cannot transfer blood fully to left ventricle. This increases heart beat
which also become irregular. The patient feels terribly tired and complains of
breathlessness. Finally congestive heart failure may occur.

Nitral Valve Prolapse:

The leaflets of mitral valve enlarged and bend towards left atrium causing back flow of
blood.

Doctors treat it with beta (8) blockers.

It may cause infection in the valve. This infection is called Endocarditis. Sometimes it
is caused by the dental treatment, hence antibiotics are given.

The treatment of Mitral & Aortic valve is done as follows :
1) Angioplasty in case of mitral or arotic stenosis - Balooning.
2) Surgical valve repair.
