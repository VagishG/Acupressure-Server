THEORY -5
In 1996, scientists discovered that clotting factors in blood, triglycerides and insulin
resistance diabetes, hypertension and smoking - all together compound the risk of
Heart disease.
a) Clotting Factors:
Clotting factors may get out of balance.
It causes red blood cells to clump together and resulting in more viscous blood.
Circulation becomes impaired.
The heart is required to work harder to pump blood through small arterioles and
capillaries.

Most heart attacks are caused by blood clots, which cuts off blood supply to a
coronary artery and starves an area of the heart muscle of vital oxygen.

On one hand we would bleed to death from the smallest of nick, without blood
clots.

Whenever there is a break in a blood vessel, platelets rush to the site of break
and form a temporary plug.

Anumber of coagulation factors in the blood are activated at the site of injury and
they form a get like clot to stop blood loss.

One of these is fibrinogen.

Frobrinogen form a net of proteins called fibrin.

Fibrin holds platelets tightly together and seals the hole.
After healing begins, fibrin is broken down.

Plasminogen is the chief player in this process. Plasmin is an enzyme which
dissolves the formed fibrin clots.

Plasminogen produces these clots busting enzyme.

This enzyme eats fibrin and removes useless clot.
Sometimes this system fails.

Blood clots in the coronary artery and causes Heart attack.
