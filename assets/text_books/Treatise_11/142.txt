Special Note : The electrocardiogram may report myocardial stain and frequent
auricular extra systole, but the vasodilator can not cure the palpitation
or the chest pain. The above mentioned treatment is useful in such

cases. Sorbitrate, isordil or nitrocon work as a vasodilator but these do
not work in case of a Biliary heart syndrome.

The ultrasound report may show chronic cholecystitis in liver or
Biliary tract. The above treatment has been effective in these cases as
well.

Sometimes hypochondrial pain relieves by simply pressing UB 18 &
UB 19. Slightly press P 6 too in case of cardiac arrhythmia.
