Varicose veins are twisted enlarged rope like blood vessels that run just beneath the
surface of the legs. About 50% of aged ladies suffer from varicose veins.

The veins have one way valves in a series. These veins bring back blood from the
legs to heart for oxygenation.

These valves prevent blood from being pulled by gravity back down to feet. As the
heart pumps, the valves open to let blood through and then shut to prevent flow from falling
backward. If one of these valves starts to malfunction, the blood leaks through it and collects
above the valve below it. This causes the vein above the lower valve to bulge.

The vein eventually becomes so large that it is visible through the surface of the skin.
Aleg in which there are many varicose veins also becomes swollen because fluid from the
blood in the bulging veins starts to leak into the tissue around the veins.

Varicose Veins

Causes of Varicose Veins :

A common cause of varicose veins in women is pregnancy; pelvic veins are
pressturised due to fetus, this further pressturises the veins of lower extremities.

Varicose veins can result from a genetic defect in the valves of the vein.

Damage to valves from deep vein thrombosis can also cause varicose veins.

Symptoms of Varicose Veins :

e@ Dull aching and heaviness in legs

@ —Cramping and swelling in lower legs

e@ The discomfort is worse after a day of standing

@ — Discolouration, inflammation and bleeding sores can develop on the skin covering
the vein

@ — Clots can also form in the distended veins

Precautions :

Wear elastic stocking in legs upto knee.

Lie down and elevate your ankles so they are higher than the level of your heart for
two- 30 minutes periods each day. This will reduce the leg swelling dramatically.
