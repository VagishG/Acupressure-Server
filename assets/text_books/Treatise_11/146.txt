Deep Veins Thrombosis (DVT)

In DVT, blood clots appear in large veins of legs.

These may be due to three reasons :

1)

Blood Stagnation in these veins

While walking, our calf muscles constrict to send back the blood upwards, to
heart. Taking a long rest, undergoing the lengthy operation or a jet lag results in
stagnation of blood in the veins of legs. Blood clots may also appear.

2) Pumping capacity of heart is reduced :
Ithappen in congestive heart failure or chronic heart failure.
3) Ifblood clots are too many :
a) Itmay be genetic
b) _ Infection, cancer or connective tissue disorder may be the reason.
c) Oral contraceptives may cause it.
d) _ Injury or surgery may cause it.
Main Symptoms :

If these clots get into the lungs, pulmonary embolism result in blood stagnation in
blood vessels of lungs.
