Electrocardiogram : ECG

Electrocardiogram is done by an electronic machine which records Herat's electrical
impulses.

The machine has 12 electrodes which are small, round and made of metal. The
electrodes have suction cups on the lower side. The patient is made to lie down. The
electrodes are fitted by means of suction cups on certain points of chest, legs and arms.
These electrodes then record the electrical signal of heart.

S.A. Node (sinoatrial node) works as a pacemaker. It maintains a regular heart beat.
It produces electrical impulses and tells the heart muscles when to contract. The contraction
itself produces electrical signal that can be recorded on the ECG graph.

Abnormal electrical currents mean the heart has some problem. It also tells
whether the injury is new or old or chronic. Heart attack, abnormal heart rhythm, thickening
or thinning of heart muscles wall, inflammation in pericardium etc. can be detected
by an ECG.

PQR STU are specific electrical waves.

Each of these can be affected by specific heart condition.

1) QRSis large spike upward, it represents on beat.

2) Wave pattern after the spike is called ST.

3) Wave pattern before the spike is called WT.

Wave pattern before and after spike should be equal.

Know heart condition after seeing cardiologist ECG.
