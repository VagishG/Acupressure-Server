Stress Test or Tread Mill Test

Stress test is electrocardiogram (ECG) taken during exercise, to evaluate the function

of heart under stress.

As in ECG, electrodes which detect electrical impulses generated by the heart are

attached to arm, legs & chest. The patient then walks on a tread mill or rides on a

stationery bike at gradually increasing speeds and degrees of difficulty. The treadmill

is elevated. The resistance of the bike is increased.

During average 10' test, blood pressure, heart rate & rhythm & symptoms such as

chest pain, shortness of breath & fatigue are constantly monitered. The electrodes

send the impulses to a machine, where they are recorded as a series of waves
representing each beat of the heart.

We can lear a lot from stress test :

1) Failure of systolic pressure to rise during exercise usually indicates problems
with heart's pumping efficiency.

2) Heart rate, arrythmias, blood pressure changes during exercise, how quickly
the heart rate returns to normal after exercise. All these are recorded &
considered.

3) How long one can exercise ? How one feels ? If one can do exercise within
expected duration & intensity without having chest pain or shortness of breath :
This is an excellent sign of good health of the heart. Exercise stress test is
safe.

In some cases it induces angina in patients with severe heart disease.
A few heart attacks during testing have been reported.

However, the stress test is safe & accurate & best screening test for heart
disease.
