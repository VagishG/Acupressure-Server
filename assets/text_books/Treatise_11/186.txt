Echocardiogram or Cardiac Ultrasound

Echocardiography is a procedure to visualise the anatomy and function of heart. It
utilises an ultrasound, machine which transmits sound waves.

The machine records the shape, size, structure & functioning of the heart.
This is done by means of sound waves.
Ahandy instrument sends painless soundwaves to record everything.

Few sound waves that fall on the heart tissues returns as echo which is received
by the instrument and processed by the computer. Thus a picture is made, which
can be visualized on the monitor.

Thus picture of a beating heart are formed.

The test reveals the following :

Abnormalities in pericardium

Abnormalities in the heart walls i.e. thickness and functioning both.

Any increase or decrease in the size of four chamber of heart: RA, RV, LA, LV
i) Right atrium (RA)

ii) Right ventricle (RV)

i) Left atrium (LA)

iv) Leftventricle (LV)

Abnormalities of heart valves

Direction & velocity of blood flow

One most important information that echocardiography provides is the ejection
fraction (E.F.).

The ejection fraction is the percentage of blood ejected from the left ventricle with
each heart beat. It is a crucial indicator of heart function.

if the heart is filled to a capacity of 100cc of blood and the next stroke pumps out
70cc, the ejection fraction is 70%.

If it pumps out only 35cc, the ejection fraction is 35%.
