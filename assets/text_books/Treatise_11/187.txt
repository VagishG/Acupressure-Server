Higher the ejection fraction means healthier, stronger & more efficient is the heart.
Anormal E.F is 60 + 6%,

The ejection fraction indicates about the function of the left ventricle and is very
reliable indicator of heart disease risk.

Patients with an EF of 50% or more have a very low risk of heart attack or death
from heart disease.

Even if such a patient have blockages in one, two or even three coronary
arteries.

If the heart is pumping efficiently, the chances of having a heart attack is one
in 100.

Patients with a poor EF ie less than 50% are at a risk of heart attacks.
Electrocardiograms are sometimes helpful in showing parts of the wall of the
heart that are not pumping effectively, which occurs in heart attack.

When the heart attack has caused congestive heart failure, echocardiograms
can also help determine how badly the heart attack is affecting the over
all.ability of the heart to pump, and whether any of the heart valves are
malfunctioning.
