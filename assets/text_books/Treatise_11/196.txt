Excess fat deprives the Heart and Arteries of Oxygen:

High fat meal produces excessive amount of triglycendes in the blood.

Too much of fat in the blood stream gums up circulation.

\t coats the red blood cells and causes them to stick together.

When triglycerides level is high, the red blood cells are sticky and can not pass through
the capillaries.

This causes a serious reduction of the O, supply to the tissues - including the heart.
For patients with heart disease, a high fat meal can bring an angina.

Angina is a suffocation pain which occurs when the heart is not getting enough oxygen.
Excess fat in the blood also harms arteries.

It damaages the endothelial cells which line the walls of the blood vessels and
decreases the availability of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide relaxes and protects the arteries.

In addition, it deprives the endothelium of oxygen. The endothelium gets its oxygen
supply from the blood which travels through the arteries.

When excessive fat in blood causes red blood cells to stick together, oxygen diffusion
is inhibited and endothelium can not function normally.

Asingle high fat meal suppresses endothelial function in the coronary artery for hours.
