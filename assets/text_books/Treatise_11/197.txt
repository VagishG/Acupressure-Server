No. 1: Bad Fats :
Saturated fats are bad fats.
These are fats in meat, eggs, dairy products, palm oil and coconut oils.
These fats are frozen at the room temperature in winter. They are loaded with hydrogen
orrancidity.
Saturated fat is primary cause of heart disease.
Saturated fat cause cells to stick together.
Hence, circulation is impaired.
It decreases oxygen delivery and increases risk of heart attack.

These fats may be stored in adipose, or fat, cells and deposited within internal organs,
contributes to obesity, heart disease and other degenerative conditions.

Saturated fats also raises blood cholestrol level.

Therapists should know :

That 1% reduction in saturated fat intake reduces the blood cholestrol level by 1%.
No. 2: Worse fats are hydrogeneted fats and trans fatty acids :

If the saturated fats are bad, hydrogenated fats and trans fatty acids are worse.

The molecules that are creatd during hydrogenation are called trans fatty acids.

These altered fats are more harmful than the saturated fats.

They elevate total cholestrol level.

They lower the HDI cholestrol.

Trans fats have been implicated in cancer, diabetes, immune dysfunction and infertility.

The biggest source of trans fatty foods are the fast foods, commercially baked goods
pasteries, cookies and cakes.

Vegetable oil is hydrogenated and is harmful for body and heart.
No. 3: Good fats are monosaturated fats :

Mono means one.

They contain one instead of two hydrogen atoms.

This leaves a gap in their structure.

Olive oil contains 74% monosaturated fatty acids. It is rich source of votamin E as well
as other antioxidants.

Thus, Heart patients should intake olive oil.
