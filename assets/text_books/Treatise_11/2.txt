b) Left side of heart - again has two parts :

i) Leftupperchamber : _ Itiscalled the left atrium where oxygenated
blood comes.
ii) Left lower chamber Itis called the left ventricle which pumps the
oxygenated blood.
The heart has four valves :
@ Twoonrightside - Pulmonary valve and Tricuspid valve.
@ Twoonleftside -  Aorticvalve and Mitral valve.

All the four valves are non returning type. They prevent backward flow of blood
through them.
i) Pulmonary vaive : (H9 R)
This is a valve between right ventricle and pulmonary artery (the only artery
which carries deoxygenated blood). The opening of the pulmonary artery is guarded
by pulmonary valve formed by three semi lunar cusps. They stop back flow of
blood.
ii) Tricuspid valve : (H8 R)
This is a valve between right atrium and right ventricle.
ili) Aortic valve : (H9L)
This is a valve between left ventricle and aorta. The opening of aorta is guarded
by aortic valve, formed by three semilunar cusps.
iv) Mitral valve : (H 8L)
This is a valve between left atrium and left ventricle.
Veins : (SMP Ci 8)
Low pressure blood vessels carrying blood from body to the heart are
veins. The veins of the limbs have one way type valves so that the blood cannot flow
back due to antigravitational force, blood moves at a slower pace in veins.

Arteries : (Ci 9 SMP)

Blood vessels carrying blood from the heart are arteries. Blood moves ata higher
pace in arteries. If there is a cut then blood flow would be faster through an artery than
avein. Arteries are bigger than veins and they have thicker walls.
