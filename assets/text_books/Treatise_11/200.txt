Excess protein stresses the Kidney :

The problem is that we consume too much of protein than needed. It harms the
Kidney. A heart patient should eat only upto 50 gms of protein. More than that would be
harmful for kidneys and ultimately for the heart.

Fat:

Itis used for energy when needed. Excess of fat is stored in the adipose, or fat cells of
body.

Carbohydrates :

Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose. The glucose is utilised to meet energy
needs. The excess glucose is stored in the liver and muscles for later use. If too much
glucose is circulating in the blood, it may be converted into fat and stored in the adipose
cells.

Carbohydrates and fats are made of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. When they are
burned for energy, the primary break down products are carbon di oxide and water.
Co, is eliminated through lungs. Water is either used by the body or easily excreted
through the Kidneys.

Protein :

Protein contains carbon, hydrogen, oxyge and nitrogen. Nitrogen compounds are
breakdown products of protein metabolism. Body has no means to store these
compounds. These compounds must be converted into urea and eliminated through
the Kidneys.

Consumption of excess protein stresses the metabolic system of the body. Holiday
for a person tentamounts to overtime work for his Kidneys.

Levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine and low when the kidneys are
healthy.

When the kidneys begin to fail, levels of BUN and creatinine rise.

The kidneys have a lot of reserve capacity.

They are generally able to handle the excesses.

Diabetes, hypertension etc. causes Kidney failure.
