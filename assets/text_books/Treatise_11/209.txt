by treatment then Heart disease can be taken care of.

DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone Hormone) :

men. A low DHEA level was predictive of heart disease, leave apart age, obesity,

diabetes, hypertension, smoking, blood lipids, alcohol intake and physical activity.

DHEA protects heart and arteries in several ways.

i) It influences enzymes which affect blood lipids and helps keep cholestrol &
triglyleride levels in check.

ii) This hormone also inhibits platlets aggregation and normalises blood clotting
factors.

ii) This hormone increases insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance & conditions known
as syndrome x are significant risk factors of heart disease.

There is inverse relationship between insulin resistance & DHEA.
High insulin levels are almost always accompanied by lower DHEA levels.

Those who have prostate, breast or other hormone sensitive cancer, a supplement of
this hormone may worsen the disease.
