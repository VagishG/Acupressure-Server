Saturate Your Cells with Hyperbaric Oxygen
Through Pranayam

Food, water and oxygen are the three requisites for life.

Our most immediate need is oxygen.

If cells are deprived of this life sustaining element for even short period of time, they
willdie.

Cut off blood and oxygen supply to brain and neurons begin to die within minutes.
Hyperbaric means above normal pressure.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy i.e., pranayam is a way of delivering massive amount of
oxygen to oxygen starved tissues.

Atnormal atmospheric pressure, oxygen is carried only on the hemoglobin in the red
blood cells.

In apressurised environment, oxygen dissolves in all of body's fluids and is transported
to all tissues, even those with a poor or absent blood supply. For example; macula
does not have blood supply but it is dependent upon oxygen supply through lymph.
Without adequate oxygen supply, the macule degenerates.

As one breathes in hyperbaric oxygen by pranayam, the cells are flooded with many
times their normal amount of oxygen. Thus, the load of work on heart is reduced toa
great extent.

Pranayam lessens damage to the heart muscle by providing dying cells with oxygen.
It minimises fluid accumulation which leads to cell death.

Pranayam gives relief from angina with 10 minutes of treatment.

Normal electrical activity of the heart is restored by pranayam.

It improves the ejection fraction (EF), which indicates the pumping efficiency of the
