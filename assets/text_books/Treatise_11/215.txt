Coronary Arteries

Cardiovascular system is basically a pump-pipe system.

Heartis the pump.

Blood vessels are the pipes.

Blood is the fluid which carries oxygen, nutrients, hormones & other vital materials to
every cell in the body.

Itis a round trip journey of the blood.

It begins when the blood leaves heart.

It flows into large arteries, which branch into small arteries, then into tiny, thin walled
capillaries.

In capillaries life sustaining oxygen & nutrients are handed over to the cells and waste
products of metabolism are picked up.

The blood then begins its return jouney towards heart & lungs through small vessels &
into large veins that empty into the right heart, where it is reprocessed for another
round of deliveries.

The heart is the engine which drives the blood over the body.

The bluish deoxygenated blood transported by the veins flows into a chamber of the
heart called right atrium.

From right atrium, it enters the right ventricle.
Right ventricle contracts & pumps this blood to the lungs.
In lungs this blood gets a fresh load of oxygen.

Now bright red & oxygen rich, the blood flows from the lungs into the left atrium of
heart.

The left atrium works as a steady, gentle pump to keep the left ventricle supplied with
fresh arterial blood.

The left ventricle in turn, pumps the blood very vigorously through the aorta.
Aorta is the biggest artery in the body.

From aorta it goes to all the tissues of the body via arteries.
