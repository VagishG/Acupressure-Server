There are small groups of pace maker cells. They initiate the pumping
rhythm of heart.

The SA Node is in the right atrium at the junction of superior Vena Cava.
Itbeats automatically.

Italso takes orders from the brain.

Brain increases or decreases the heart rate by sending signals to the nerves
of SA node.

Brain constantly monitors :

a) Thelevel of O, in the blood.

b) Physically excertion.

c) Pressure in arteries.

Accordingly the brain controls the heart rate.

The moment we get up our B.P. falls and this message is carried to the brain by
the nerves of arteries. Brain orders SA node to increase the heart rate.

The SA node sends signals as electric impulses to initiate heart beats which
constricts the left and right atrium. This way the blood gets into the ventricles.

The electric impulse then moves on to the atrioventricular node (AV Node), which
is situated on the wall of atrial septum. A V node is also capable of initiating
impulse that cause contraction but at a slower rate than S A node.

From A V node this impulse move to A V bundle which contracts left and right
ventricles simultaneously. This way the blood in the ventricle gets pumped over.

HIS CONDUCTION SYSTEM OF HEART
HEARTS INTRINSIC CONDUCTION SYSTEM

Heart has an intrinsic system of automatic functioning without the need for a nerve
supply from the brain.

HIS system can be stimulated or depressed by :
