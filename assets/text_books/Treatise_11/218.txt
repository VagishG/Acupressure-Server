2) Middle layer called media:
Itis layer of smooth muscle tissues.
3) Inner layer called intima:
Itis line with special cells called endothelial cells or the endotheleum.

The endothelium gives the artery a smooth surface ideal for blood flow through
the lumen.

Lumen is the opening inside the artery.

Endothelial cells produce chemical messengers which govern the muscle tone
of the arteries. Itinstructs the muscles of the arteries to constrict or relax in order to
direct the blood, where it is needed most.

One of these chemical messengers is the angiotensin - converting enzyme (ACE).
It converts an in active blood component into angiotensin II (A Il).
Allis a powerful & useful constricter of arteries.

When there is an excess of A Il, the arteries constrict too much. It raises, blood pressure
& increases the risk of heart attack.

Endothelium releases another important compound named nitric oxygen (NO).
NOis a vasodilator or relaxor of arteries.

lt controls tension in the arteries.
NO is primarily regulator of blood pressure.
It also guards against atherosclerosis.
It prevents platlets & W.B.C. from sticking to artery walls.
It discourages clumping together of platlets.
Thus it prevents formation of dangerous blood clots.
NO also does not allow the underlying muscle cells from multiplying & thickening.
There are two types of sclerosis :
1) Arteriosclerosis :
Arterio means arteries
Sclerosis means hardening or scarring
