Heart attack

Coronary infarction

Myocardial infarction

These are names of the same thing caused by a severe blockage in one or
more of the coronary arteries making it unable to deliver fresh blood & O, to the
throbbing heart muscles.

Atherosclerosis

H.B.P. smoking, diabetes, high cholestrol level, high triglyceride, infections
of the inner lining of arteries damage the inner most layer of arteries causing
microscopic craks in them. Fats starts depositing in these cracks. This fat
deposition causes blockage in arteries which resists blood flow in them.

As it muscles of the heart have to exhert more pressure because of HBP and
when sclerosis occurs the cells of the muscles do not receive enough O, or
other nutrients. So HBP and arterial sclerosis together may become a causative
factor for heart failure.

In atherosclerosis, fatty deposits in inner lining of arteries restricts the blood flow
through them as the passage becomes narrow.

Atherosclerosis may cause :

1)

Sclerosis of coronary arteries :
Block in the arteries of heart can cause chest pain (angina) or heart attack.
