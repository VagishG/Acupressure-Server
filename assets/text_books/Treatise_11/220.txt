Blockage in the arteries of brain may cause stroke.

Strokes are of two types :

blood vessel.

ii) Stroke due to brain haemorrhage.

; erosis plaque

In early adulthood ie late teen age years, the deopsited fatty particles in the intima
of the artries, start forming a fatty streak, plaque or a flat area or plate.

Stage5:

Over years, the accumulation of fat continues and the plaque of atheroscleosis grows

alarger.

The fatty deposit in the plaque is covered by a tissue called fibrous cap.
The piaque begins to bulge into the open channel through which blood flows.

The wall of the artery thickens.
