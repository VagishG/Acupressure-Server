O Stage6:
The process continues progressively narrowing the channel. At some place, the blood
flow is obstructed enough so that one develops angina.

Angina is developed when a part of the heart served by that artery has to work very
hard.

0 Stage7:
Sometimes the fibrous cap ruptures.
Blood cells travelling through the channel meets with the fatty inside of the plaque.
This causes a blood clot to form at the site of the rupture.
This change can occur quite suddenly, and accounts for many heart attacks.
Angina is a fore waming of ensuing heart attack.
Causes of heart diseases :
Heart muscles & coronary arteries work very hard.
The heart beats on an average 1 lac. times daily.
Heart & muscles incessantly work the whole life - Itis a wonder.
However glitches do occur.
Arteries clog.
Heart muscles fail.
Disease sets in : A number of things can go wrong.
1) Sometimes the problem is with the blood itself.
2) Sometimes the fault lie in the heart muscle.
3) Coronary artery disease.
1) Problems with the blood :

i) Thevascular system of arteries & veins is a network of progressively smaller
vessel, ending in tiny capillaries where the actual exchange of oxygen & the
nutrients take place.

ii) Some ofthese capillaries are so small that the RBC must pass through ina
single line one by one.

ili) Sometimes these individual RBC are actually required to bend & flex in order
to pass through.
