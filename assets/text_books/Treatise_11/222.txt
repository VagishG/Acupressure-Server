The heart muscle may be enlarged or weakened by disease or subject to
rhythmic disturbances.

The left ventricle is of particular concern in heart disease.

Poor left ventricular function worsens the prognosis of heart patients.
Uncontrolled hypertension causes poor left ventricular function.

Problem with heart muscle such as cardiomyopathy & congestive heart
failure and rhythm are not due to coronary artery disease.

Coronary artery disease :

Coronary artery disease is a disease of the arteries.
Damage to the coronary arteries narrows the pathways.
It restricts the blood flow to the hungry heart muscle.

Itis caused by atherosclerosis or building up of plaque in the arteries.
Itis responsible for the majority of heart disease.
The same process occuring in other arteries may bring on :
