Arteries are pathways of blood flowing from the heart throughout the body.

When we exercise, the arteries of our active limbs expand to allow for the increased
oxygen & nutrient requirement of muscles at work.

When we get up from a reclining position, the arteries quickly divert blood to our brain,
so we do not feel light headed.

Atherosclerosis :
Atherosclerosis is caused by some sort of injury or insult to the endothelial cells.

It may be physical trauma.

Asudden spasm in an artery caused by a stress related hormone which causes the
arteries to constrict. It may cause a minute tear in the endothelium.

Hypertension or high blood pressure may injure the endothelium.

It may be a slight scratch in an artery during performing angiography or angioplasty.
Following toxins also damage the endothelial cells.

Blood bome toxins eg. infectious agents.

Cigarette smoke.

Excess of blood glucose.

Insulin

Oxidised low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestrol.

Suppose there is a scratch on the body, it would appear red. May be followed
by swelling. It is because of the inflammation. So the immune system gets activated
and resolves the scratch etc. Same way the arteries may get damaged due to some
friction.

Causes of Friction :

Physical trauma

Microbial Infection

Metabolic toxins

Dietary toxins
