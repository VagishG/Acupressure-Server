Blood fats, particularly LDL cholestrol also runs to the sight of injury.

Here is where atherosclerosis starts.

LDI binds at the spot where repairing is needed.

Rather than facilating the process of repairing the damaged artery, oxidised LDL adds
insult to injury.

At one side the LDL gets attached to the artery and the WBC or monocytes also get
stuck inside.

This normally happens during repairing and slowly plaques appear at the site of damage.
They reduce the diameter of arteries resisting the blood flow through these.. Hence
progressive atherosclerosis becomes a factor for heart disease.

Arteries do not have nerve endings. Hence there is no pain after any damage, injury,
blockage or plaque formation.

So the damaged can not be noticed untill heart attack. Some patients may suffer from
such fatal first heart attack.

The Plaques are vulnerable :

Whether or not an arterial plaque will cause a heart attack is not the size of the plaque
but its composition.

There are various types of plaques :

a) Some plaques are large, hard & fibrous.

These plaques protude into the lumen of arteries and narrows the diameter by
as much as 80%. These large hard & stable plaques are not the primary culprit
in heart disease.
b) Vulnerable or unstable plaques are small leisons and are soft, lipid rich core
topped within a thin fibrous cap.
These vulnerable plaques can rupture and cause heart attacks. This rupture
may be caused by :
i) | Mechanical forces : can cause a rupture in vulnerable plaques & may
cause leison to open due to
Sudden increae in blood pressure
Sudden increase in force of heart beat
These are triggered by stress related hormonal surges.
