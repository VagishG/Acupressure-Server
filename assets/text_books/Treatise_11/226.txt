Stable angina : It is most common type of angina. It comes on when there is
an increased need for O, by the heart during physical activity or periods of
emotional extremes, stress or excess heat or excess cold, when hormonal
surges constrict the arteries.

Stable angina is not a heart attack

It doen't last longer than one minute.

Patient feels normal after a minute.

Unstable angina :

Itis considered to be serious.

It may occur at rest.

It tends to be progressive in frequency, severety & duration.
Unstable angina is precipitated by an abrupt coronary event viz.
i) Aspasm inartery

ii) The rupture of a plaque

ili) The formation of a blood clot in an artery

Although this type of angina is not a heart attack. This is called intermediate
coronary syndrome or preinfarction angina.

Silent Ischemia :

Itis caused by the same mechanism as angina.

In such cases the heart doesnot receive adequate O, supply temporarily and the
patient can not detect it. It is only detected by an ECG.

Few peple suffer from angina pain if they have some heart disease but some do not
face it. The reason is not known as the why this happens.

Silent ischemia is indicator of heart disease.

Angina is also indicator of the same.

Muscles of the heart suffer from infraction after a heart attack as the damage is done.
Obstruction in coronary artery hampers adequate O,, supply of heart.

WBC called lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells rush to the area of attack.
They produce massive amount of radicals.

This radicals damage the heart tissue or myocardium.
