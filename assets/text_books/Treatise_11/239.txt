Circulation of Blood in the Body

1)
2)
3)

The deoxygenated blood from the whole body comes though the vena cava.

The vena cava brings blood into the right atrium of heart.

From the right atrium it gets into the right ventricle.

From right ventricle it comes to the pulmonary aorta and then via right and left
pulmonary artery it gets to the right and left lungs, where exchange of O, and CO,
take place.

The oxygenated blood is now carried by the pulmonary vein back into the heart to its
left atrium. It moves into the left ventricle and is then pumped into the aorta. The aorta
supplies blood to the whole body.

Hence, we know that the blood passes from right to left via lungs.

Both atria contract at the same time simultaneously and so do the ventricles.

Blood in intestines :

When the blood passes through the intestines it collects nutrients & liquids which
have been digested & absorbed.

Blood in liver :

From intestines the blood goes to liver. Liver removes toxins & toxic substances
from the blood. Liver also adds essential proteins (such as clotting factors) to the
blood.

Blood in Kidneys :

Blood unloads excess fluids, acids & minerals in the kidney, which is excreted as
urine.

Blood in Spleen:

In the spleen, the blood unloads old & exhausted blood cells, which are then broken
down.
