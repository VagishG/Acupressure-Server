Four one way valves control the blood flow through the heart.

The valves open to let the blood go out of heart chambers.

Then the valves close tightly to prevent blood from moving backward in the
wrong direction.

Ifa valve is stenotic i.e too narrow & stiff - The heart may not be able to pump
enough blood.

If a valve is insufficient - it does not close properly and thus allows blood to flow
backward in the wrong direction.
