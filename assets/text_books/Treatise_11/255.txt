\f someone is bleeding then care should be taken so that the person does not sweat
as it would only dilute the blood. Bleeding patients should not be given dry food or
drying food.
‘Big bleeding do not cause sweat.
Big sweat do not cause bleeding.’

{Chapter 18 of ‘Spiritual Axis’)

Heart controls blood and sweat alike. If heart Qi is low accompanied by heavy sweating
tone heart yang. Night sweating occurs when heart yin is low so tone it. For heavy
sweating heart should be treated.

During a heart attack patients suffers from severe chest pain which radiates to left
arm and runs through the heart or pericardium meridian with heavy sweating.

This way the water content of blood reduces making it thick & reducing its volume.
Sleep and Dreams :

The mind resides in the heart. If the heart is healthy & blood is sufficient- a person falls
asleep easily and gets a sound sleep. When heart Qi is low falling asleep takes time &
itis laden with dreams.

Aweak heart may get you dream of fire, mountains, smoke etc. in summers it may be
volcanoes or skin rashes may appear.

In case of heart excess — dreams of laughter may be seen.
Effects of weather on heart :
Normally the weather does not effect the heart excepts for heat but heat only effects
the pericardium.
“If external pathogenic factors attack the heart, they penetrate the Pericardium
instead.”

(Chapter 71 of the ‘Spiritual Axis’)
Emotions :
Joy:
Joy is directly related with heart. Too much of enjoyment may cause trouble as excess
excitement lowers the heart Qi. Happiness strengthens the heart.
