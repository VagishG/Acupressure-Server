Heart disease.

atherosclerosis which ultimately may cause heart attack.
THEORY - 2
In 1980's scientists discovered that the cholestrol is of three types :
1) HDLcholestrol (High Density Lipoprotein)
2) LDLcholestrol (Low Density Lipoprotein)
3) VLDLcholestrol (Very Low Density Lipoprotein)
1) HDLcholestrol (High Density Lipoprotein) :
i)  Itismade up of mroe protein and less fat.
ii) Itis called high density lipoprotein.
ili) Itis also called good cholestrol.
Why? Because it brings out excessive cholestrol out of the cells and artery
walls.
iv) People with high HDL level are less prone to heart attacks.
2) -LDL cholestrol (Low Density Lipoprotein) :
i) _ LDLis alighter particle made mostly of fat and less protein.
ii) _ Ittransports cholestrol to the tissues.
