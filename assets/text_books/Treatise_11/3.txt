LDL cholestrol which has been oxidised or damaged by free radicals, is
deposited on the wall of artery.

It contributes to atherosclerosis.
The elevated level of LDL is harmful.

(Radical is a group of atoms acting as a single unit, which passes without
a change in it from one compound to another but not able to exit in a free
state).

VLDL cholestrol is made up of more fat than LDL.

Itis the lightest transporter.

tis primarily carrier of triglycerides.

An elevated level of triglycerdes is another risk factor for Heart disease.
Some VLDL is converted into LDL cholestrol.

Ahigh level of VLDL is very harmful.

Hence.

HDLis a protective cholestrol for arteries.

LDL and VLDL are harmful for arteries.

(Fatty substances in the blood are triglycerides, which are insoluble in water
and hence are transported in combination with protein, as lipoproteins.
Triglycerides are combination of glycerol and three fatty acids.)

In 1990's scientists discovered that atherosclerosis is primarily caused by
homocysteine.

Homocystein is a bye product of amino acid metabolism. This homocystein is the
primary instigator of the endothelial damage that cause atherosclerosis.

THEORY -4

In 1994, scientists discovered that inflammation is the most significant risk factor of
all, which causes atherosclerosis.
