Adecrease in methylation hampers body's cleaning system thus increasing
the level of homocysteine and other metabolic waste products. This can
lead to atherosclerosis which may cause heart attack, alzhemeir's disease
even cancer.

Homocysteine damages blood vessels.

Production of nitric oxide goes down.

Production of Nitric-Oxide goes down.

Platelets becomes stickier causing blood clots and finally heat attack.

A proper methylation process can keep the levels of homocystein low.
This can be done by maintaining proper levels of folic acid, vitamin B 6 and
B 12 in body.

This way homocystein converts into cystein, which is a harmless amino
acid. Energy is released as the protein gets digested.

c) Low Antioxidants can cause Atherosclerosis :

Any chemical reaction. that involves oxygen (oxidation) creates free
radicals.

Production of energy in the cells is oxidation.

It creates free radicals.

Free radicals lack an electron so are very unstable and highly reactive.
They are treated by antioxydants.

Antioxidants nourish the inner lining of endothelial cells and protect them.
They also prevent oxidation of LDL cholestrol.

They increase the level of HDL.

They also strengthen the walls of the capillaries.

Adeficiency of vtamin E causes more damage to arteries than HBP or high
cholestrol. Vitamin E is an antioxidants.

We can increase the antioxidant level through diets and supplements.
