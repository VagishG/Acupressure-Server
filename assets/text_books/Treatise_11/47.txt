Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease.

Every injury in the body, whether it is an abrasion on the skin or a damage to
the endothelial cells linning of the arteries, it alerts the immune system.
Immune system gives inflammatory response.

Inflammation facilitates healing of an injured area. Itis a normal part of immune
response.

Decades of injury and irritation to the endothelium results in arteries plugged
with large, stable plaque and smaller, vulnerable plaque filled with inflammatory
compounds.

The overburdened immune system may turn from friend to foe.

It causes vulnerable plaques which lead to plaque eruption and thrombus

formation. Thromus formation may lead to heart attack.

Chronic inflammation is thus a cause of heart disease.

One of the best markers of inflammation is c-reactive protein.

C-reactive protein is manufactured in Liver.

Itis manufactured in response to inflammation anywhere in the body including

the arteries.

Scientific research and surveys have shown that highest level of.c-reactive _
protein causes a risk of stroke and heat attack.
An elevated c-reactive protein levels may be present in the blood six to eight
years before cardiovascular event took place.

C-reactive protein is very strong predictor of future Heart attack or other
coronary disease :

C-reactive protein is stronger than cholestrol.
Inflammation may be difficult to curb.
Dietary measures may dampen inflammation.

Small doses of aspirin and natural anti-inflammatory agents may reduce
inflammation and may be one of the best defenses against heart disease.
