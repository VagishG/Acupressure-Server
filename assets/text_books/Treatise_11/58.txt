High blood pressure is intimately related to heart disease.

Hypertension causes very heavy stress on blood vess! walls. Consequently
the endothelium gets damaged. it causes ageing of heart and arteries before
their time.

High blood pressure triples the risk of dying of heart attack.

HBP increases the risk of heart failure by four times.

HBP increases the risk of stroke by seven times.
