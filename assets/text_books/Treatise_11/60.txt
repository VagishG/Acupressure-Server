Cardiac Arrest

Cardiac arrest occurs when heart suddenly stops pumping.
Causes of disease :
i) Abnormal rhythms of the ventricles is the main cause of cardiac arrest.

Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are responsible for 90% of the
cardiac arrest.

ii) The other 10% cases of cardiac arrest are caused by heart block, in which the
heart stops pumping frequenly enough to sustain life or abnormal rhythms of the
atria in which the heart is beating too rapidly to pump blood efficiently.

What causes abnormal rhythms of the ventricle, which in turn causes cardiac
arrest?

i) â€” Inmost people cardiac arrest is caused by coronary artery disease.

ii) Cocaine can trigger cardiac arrest by causing the coronary arteries to spasm,
which deprives the heart muscles of oxygen.

il) Viral infection of the heart muscles can also cause the abnormal heart thythms
which lead to cardiac arrest.

iv) Inrare cases accidental electric shocks excessive intake of alcohol or hereditary
conditions of heart muscles may cause cardiac arrest.

Emergency treatment of cardiac arrest :

Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is the emergency treatment of cardiac arrest.
Resuscitation is restoration of life after apparent death.

i) Inthis system mouth to mouth resuscitation is done to help person breaths.

i) | Chestcompression is done to help the person's heart pump blood.

Method of doing CPR:

1) Let the patient lie down on a hard, flat surface & check the mouth & throat for
passage of air.
If there is anything obstructing the passage-remove it.
Make sure to wear disposable surgical gloves.
