Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet body's needs.
In heart failure in most cases the left ventricle of the heart begins to fail as a pump.
In some cases the right ventricle of the heart begins failing as a pump.

Left ventricles job is to pump oxygenated blood to whole of the body.

Right ventricle's job is to pump oxygen poor blood into lungs to make it oxygen rich.

Left ventricle is unable to pump enough blood from heart to the whole body.
Many organs start malfunction due to paucity of O, rich blood.

For example insufficient blood flow in brain, kidney & muscles causes weakness
& fatigue.

When the left ventricle fails to pump sufficient quantity of O, rich blood from
the heart to the whole body, the blood goes back to lungs first, then to the
right ventricle.

If the right ventricle is also failing, the blood goes back to veins.

When the blood goes back to lungs, breathing becomes difficult, even at rest.
When the blood goes back in the veins, fluid starts to leak from the vein into the
tissues, causing swelling. Swelling can be seen in the body, especially legs.
Swelling may occur in lungs, abdomen & liver. When the fluid is retained in the
body, weight increases.

Symptoms of CHF may be mild or severe.

Symptoms of CHF may develop gradually or suddenly.

CHF may affect the working of other organs. When there is low blood in kidneys,
it starts retaining salt & water. This adds to the swelling & the weight increases.
In turn this increases hearts work load.

There are four types of congested heart failure (CHF) :

Class 1 CHF:
The patient can perform ordinary physical activity without noting any symptoms.
