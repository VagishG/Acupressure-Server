Diabetes and heart disease go together hand in glove.

75% of the diabetics die of heart attacks. Excess glucose in the blood damage
the blood vessels.

It makes the blood thicker and more concentrated.

Hence the blood is less able to deliver oxygen and other nutrients.
Circulation is impaired.

Blood flow to important organs including heart is restricted.

Diabetes causes over all degeneration and ageing in the eyes and kidneys
are also affected by diabetes.

Due to diabetes blood vessels loose their elasticity.

Even more prevalent than diabetes is insulin resistance. It is the underlying
cause of type-2 diabetes.

Insulin resistance is not caused by a failure of the pancreas to produce
insulin. The essence of type 1 diabetes is that pancreas does not produce
insulin.

Insulin resistance is caused by :

an inability of cells to allow insulin to usher in glucose.

Itresults in excessive level of both glucose and insulin in the blood.
Insulin resistance is one of the factors for problems of syndrome X.

a) 50% ofthe heart attacks are caused because of insulin resistance.
b) tis a predictor of heart disease.

c) Insulin resistance is characterised by hyperinsulinemia (high insulin
level in the blood).

d) Whenlevels of insulin in the blood remain high, protective HDL cholestrol
falls and harmful LDL cholestrol particles are created.

e) Hyperinsulinemia causes inflammation.
