Pacemaker Syndrome
or
Sick Sinus Syndrome or Adams Stroke Syndrome

Itis a condition in which the heart's natural pacemaker the sinoatrial node (SA Node)

does not send its signal regularly.

Usually the signal is too infrequent & therefore the heart rate is too slow.

Sometimes, the heart rate alternates between beating too slowly (bradycardia) and

too quickly (tachycardia). The combination is called bradytachycardia syndrome.

Main Symptoms :

If the heart slows down mildly, the only symptom may be fatigue.

Adramatic drop in heart rate can cause weakness, dizziness, fainting or even cardiac

arrest.

Ultimately a stroke can result.

Treatment option :

1) Doctors try to normalise the heart beat with the help of medicines.

2) Pacemaker is implanted to restore normal heart beat.

3) Pacemaker consists of a small box called an impulse generator, which sends a
tiny electrical signal through a wire which goes through the vein to the heart.
The pacemaker is implanted beneath the skin near the collarbone. The pacemaker
sends tiny electrical signals to the heart Chambers to keep the heart beating in
anormal rhythm. They run on batteries which work for 7 to 12 years.

Sick sinus syndrome occurs when heart's autonomic transmission of nerve impulses

gets disturbed. The reason may be inflammation of sinus node or deficiency of blood

in heart. It causes bradycardia along with certain symptoms. In serious cases Adam

stroke syndrome can appear which may be fatal. Pace maker is implanted in such

cases. But cost of pacemaker is quite high and many patients simply cannot afford it.

Traditional Chinese Acupuncture has a remedy for that.
