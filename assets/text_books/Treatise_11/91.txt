A healthy waist / hip ratio for women should be less than 0.8 and for men
less than 0.95.

Measure the hip at its widest.
Divide waiste measurement by the hip measurement.
Thus we can find out the waist - hip ratio.
For example :
1) Ifthe waiste is 30 inches
and the hip is 36 inches
waiste / hip ratio : 30/36 = 0.83
This is within the normal range
2) _ Ifthe waiste is 36 inches
and the hip is 35 inches
waiste / hip ratio = 36/35 = 1.03

This is above normal.
