Normal Heart Rythm :

a) Aheartbeat involves contraction of the two ventricles, which pump blood to the
test of the body.

Tachycardia

b) ~The contraction of the two ventricles is preceded by contraction of the two atria,
which fill the ventricles with blood.

c) a&b together comprise one heart beat.

The heart rests between two beats. At this time the oxygenated blood gets into
the coronary artery through aorta empowering the heart muscles.

d) Every beat originates by an electrical impulse generated by sinoatrial node.
(S.A. node) is made up of special type of muscle cells. Itis called pacemaker & it
is situated on the right wall of right atrium.

e) The signals from the S.A. node goes to upper chambers first which are left & right
atrium. It causes their contraction. Then this impulse move ahead to atrioventricular
node (A.V. node). A.V. node is also a bundle of specialized cells.

f) The signals of A.V. node pass through bundle branches & reach the ventricles
within a fraction of a second causing contraction in ventricles.

g) During exercise or physical exertion the heart beat increases which is normal,
anxiety also increase the heart beat. The body needs more of oxygen at this time
hence the rapid pulse.

h) The following may increase heart beat :

e Fever
e Anemia
e@ = Hyperthyroid

@ Due to some drugs

i) Irregular heart beat is caused by a disorder of electrical system. It may be a
simple disorder or fetal as it affects the contraction of atrium or ventricles.

An abnormal increase in heart beats called tachycardia:
