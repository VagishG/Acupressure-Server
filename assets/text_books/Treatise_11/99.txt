Atrial flatter

Atrial Tachycardia :

It results when electrical impulses are generated from somewhere in the atria
other than S. A. node.

The heart beats faster than usual but in a regular fashion.

When the condition comes on suddenly and lasts between a few seconds to
several hours, it is called paroxymal atrial tachycardia (PAT) PAT is caused due
to disruption of signals to AV node. it is normally caused by emotional stress.
Itis not a serious problem. It can be a serious problem if it is since birth.

Atrial Fibrillation :

It is a common heart rhythm disturbance. instead of forcefully contracting in a
coordinated manner, the walls of left and right atria quiver and do not effectively
pump blood into the ventricles.

The condition lasts for a while and resolves on its own.
Sometimes it lasts longer.

Itcan occur in people, who have otherwise healthy heart.
Itis more common in those who have heart valve disorders.

Hyperthyroid, lungs disease, pulmonary embolus and inflammation of hearts lining
may cause atrial fibrillation.

Itis often caused by coronary artery diseaase.
Atrial fibrillation indicates three conditions :
1) _ Itcan signal the presence of another disorder.
