The respiratory system enables oxygen to enter the body & carbon di oxide to leave
the body.

The function of the respiratory system is to exchange two gases; oxygen and carbon
dioxide

The exchange takes place between the millions of alveolis (arq@rss) inthe lungs and
the capillaries (qaH Xb atfefyat) which surround the alveolis.
The inhaled oxygen moves from the alveoli (arqaraal) to the blood in the capillaries

(qax tp arfeFrai) & carbon di oxide moves from the blood in the capillaries to the
alveoli,

The oxygenated blood travels from the lungs to the left side of the heart via pulmonary

vein. (puppet Pert)
