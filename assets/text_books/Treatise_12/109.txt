A person first inhales deeply, then exhales vigorously and as quickly as
possible through the tubing.

The recording device measures the volume of air inhaled or exhaled and the
length of time each breath takes.

Use of this test

i)

ii)

iii)

iv)

This test is used to assess the stiffness & elasticity of lungs & rib cage as well
as strength of respiratory muscles

The measurements are abnormally low in following disorders.

a) Pulmonary fibrosis (pg ot aequaan)

b) Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) Favs wT BA SY AR YA STAT

c) A variety of neuromuscular disorders (earguei fereimferai) that cause
weakness of the diaphragm & other respiratory muscles such as :
¢ Myasthenia gravis (mix dei gdera)
e Guillain barre syndrome

Flow rate measurement indicates narrowing or obstruction of airway. The
measurement is abnormal in following obstructive disorders :

a) Bronchitis (gant aferat cr ware)

b) Emphysema (argeastfe)

c)  Asthama (aH)

The flow rates help in detecting the following disorders :

a) Abnormalities that partially block the larynx (*axaa)

b) — Abnormalities that partially block the trachea (wind pipe) ¥arat WomeT

Muscle strength assessment indicates the following abnormalities :

a) Adisease which weakens the muscles makes breathing more difficult. It
results in low pressure during inhalation & exhalation. This happens in
the case of muscular destrophy. (deft safer)

b) | Whether a person on ventilator (*atd) will be able to breath after the
ventilator is taken off.

Ventilator is a mechanical device for artificial ventilation of lungs
Ventilation means supplying of fresh air.
