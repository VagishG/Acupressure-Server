The process of breathing out ie exhalation (4 BISxT) is usually passive when
a person is on rest. Energy stored in the elasticity of lungs & chest wall, is
used to expel air out of the lungs.

Therefore when a person is at rest, no effort is needed by the respiratory
muscles.

During vigorous exercise, a number of muscles assist in exhalation.
The abdominal muscles are the most important of these.

Abdominal muscles contract, raise abdominal pressure and push the relaxed
diaphragm against the lungs, causing air to be expelled.
