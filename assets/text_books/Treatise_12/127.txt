Hence, quantity of air inhaled and exhaled per minute varies directly with the level of
activity.

More activity, needs more air
Less activity needs less air

Breathing Process :

i) Air is inhaled through nose or mouth where larger impurities in air are filtered.
ii) Further the air moves through trachea (wind pipe), which is of a thumb's width.
Trachea (ara =ei) is a wind pipe which takes air from nose to bronchi.

iii) | From trachea, the air goes to smaller pipes called bronchi (garaafermr)

Bronchi (aieAfe@tt) are division of air tubes which goes from wind pipe
(trachea) to lungs.

iv) From bronchi the air goes to even smaller tubes called bronchioles
(enearertferae) |
v) From bronchioles the air goes to alveolis. Alveolies are network of lacs of
microscopic air sacs (argetferai) |
