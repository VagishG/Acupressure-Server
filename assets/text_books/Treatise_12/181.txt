1. Average person breathes about 20,000 litres of air every 24 hours. Weight of this air is
more than 20 kg.

2. This air contains toxic particles dust (fÂ¥g}), soot (@rsiet), mold (awasa), fungi (per),
bacteria (qeHtsitd)), viruses (fay) etc.

3. The toxic particles (dure varef av) deposit on airways and alveolar surface. (aTgwrsa

4. The respiratory system has an inbuilt defense system <o protect it from toxic particles.

5. One important defense system is the cilia. (gaia aieral & gfifefernt arfirarsiy &
Prmery art Yar wael st ecren, Te ae eet Bui HT aTex a BR webct ea al)
Cilias are tiny muscular projection, which line the airways.
The airways are covered by a liquid layer (za aI Xa) which is propelled by cilia.
Cilias beat 1000 times per minute. They move the mucous 0.5 to 1 cm per minute.
Mucous lines the trachea. (ait soTIct)

6. Particles & pathogens are trapped on this mucous. This mucous layer is sent to mouth
for spitting or swallowing, (Gari aur vd MT SRG Yaraiat vers ART eps fee set aI

7. There is another defense system inside lungs where gas exchange takes place.

There are mobile cells on the surface of alveoli (ary@s5al). These mobile cells are
called phagocytes, (arg a@rsoay at ade ox Ter arett aired aldt 21 ga wet Branit

These phagocytes (war BIRraTe) ingest (Fret SIT) the deposited particles & kill the
living microbes (sitfact *rTe]), bacteries (Yarsidh), virus (FAH) etc & digest them.
