The left side of the heart pumps the blood to the rest of the body.

Carbon di oxide rich blood comes from the entire body to the right side of the heart
through two large veins, the superior vena cava (SUX a HEIR) & inferior vean cava.
(fer at eTfeRT)

Then the blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery (paper erty) to the lungs,
where it takes oxygen & releases carbon di oxide.

To continue the exchange of oxygen & carbon di oxide, about 6 to 10 litres of fresh air
per minute is brough into the lungs.

About 3/10 litre ie 300 ml Itr. of oxygen is transferred from the alveoli (arqe@rees) te the
blood each minute, even when the person is at rest

At the same time, a similar volume of carbon di oxide moves from the blood to the
alveoli and is exhaled, (ara & gt Prater)

During exercise, one takes upto 100 litres of air per minute and extracts upto 3 litres of
oxygen from the air per minute.

The transfer of oxygen from the outside air to the blood involves three processes :

2) Diffusion that a fara :
It is the spontaneous movement of gases, without the use of any energy or

effort by the body, between the gas in the alveoli and the blood in pulmonary
capillaries.
