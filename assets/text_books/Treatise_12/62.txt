Treatment :
Group | Tone t UB 12, 13, 14
also do cupping on UB 12, 13, 14

UB 12 It is the gateway through which wind evil, cold evil, wet evil, heat evil etc
attacks the human body. Through this gateway these evils can be expelled
also

UB13: It is the back shu point of lungs. The lungs energy is transported through
this point.

UB 14; It is the back shu point of pericardium

UB 12, UB 13 & UB 14 : These three points together can expel external evils from the
body, can open lungs energy and calm asthama. Since UB
12, 13 and 14 are situated near thoracic vertebrae 2, 3, &5 on
the sympathetic trunk, which is the reflex area of respiration
function, cupping this area cures the constant spasm of the
bronchia and thus cures asthama.
