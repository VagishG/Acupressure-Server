Tuberculosis (T.B.) is an infectious disease (tmprH@ WM). It is caused by airborne
bacteria (arg @ ther? aren afacfam) named mycobaterium tuberculosis
Tuberculosis usually affects the lungs, although it can attack almost any organ in the
body.
How infection develops ? da aman aga t ?
i) Many T.B. bacteria which enters the lungs are immediately killed by the body's
defenses
ii) Those which survive are captured inside white blood cells called macrophages.
(Heras aplfRtaptd)
iti) The captured bacteria can remain alive inside these cells in a dormant state
(ARATaRUT) for many years.
iv) In 90 to 95% of cases, these bacteria never cause any further problem
v) In about 5 to 10% of infected people they start to muliply (@@4 eT). It is in

this active phase that an infected person actually becomes sick and can spread
the disease.

vi) Activation of dormant bacteria happens within the first 2 years. It happens so
when the person's immune system becomes impaired
Transmission of infection WHan a vs cafes BGR aAfep 4 aR :
i) Bacteria of TB can live only in people. It cannot be carried by animals, insects,
soil or other non living objects.

ii) A person can be infected with TB only from another person, who has active
