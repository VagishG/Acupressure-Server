Pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale)

The heart's right pumping chamber (right ventricle) becomes dialated and weak

The right ventricle is unable to send blood fully & effectively into lungs. The left ventrical
remains normal

Cor pulmonale is caused by chronic lungs disease like chronic bronchitis & emphysema.

High blood pressure in the arteries of lungs causes cor pulmonale. In the long run
emphysema or chronic bronchitis destroys the small air sacs and blood vessels in the
lungs. It makes it difficult for oxygen to get into blood.

Lower blood oxygen levels cause the arteries in the lungs to clamp down
It raises pressure in the pulmonary arteries

It is called pulmonary hypertension. Hence the right verticle has to work harder to
pump blood against the increased pressure.

Another cause of pulmonary hypertension may be blood clots that struck in the blood
vessels of the lungs

In young women sometimes the pulmonary hypertension is caused due to unknown
reasons. Pulmonary hypertension is sometimes caused by drugs like fenfluramine &
dexfenfluramine
