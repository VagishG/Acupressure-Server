Two kidneys which form urine

Two ureters, which send the urine from kidneys to urinary bladder Ureters are the
tubes starting from the pelvis of kidneys to the urinary bladder.

One urinary bladder : A store where from the kidneys collects & is temporarily
stored.

One unrethra, through which the urine is discharged from the urinary bladder to
exterior. Urethra is tube attached to the urinary bladder, which leads to the outside of

The urine then goes to the urinary bladder through the ureters at a low pressure.

From the urinary bladder, urine goes through urethra and exits the body through
the penis in males and the vulva in females.

‘The urinary tract is composed of two kidneys, two ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. Blood enters the kidneys
thorough the renal arteries. The kidneys filter waste material out of the blood and eliminate it from the body in the urine.
The kidneys also regulate the acid-base balance and the amount of water and minerals in the body.
