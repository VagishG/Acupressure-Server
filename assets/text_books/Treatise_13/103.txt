38 | Nephrritis

Nephritis is inflammation of the kidneys.

Cause of disease
e It may be caused by a bacterial infection of the kidneys. Bacterial infection of

kidneys cause pyelonephritis.
e â€” Exposure to a toxin causes nephritis.
e@ More commonly nephritis develops from an abnormal immune reaction, which

can occur in two ways :

(i) An antibody can attack the kidney itself.

(i) An antigen and antibody can combine somewhere else in the body & then

attach to the cells in kidney.

Nephritis most often affects the microscopic blood vessels called glomeruli. Such
inflammation is called glomerulonephritis.

When glomerulus is damaged, substances such as proteins, red blood cells and
white blood cells can pass with urine.

Progressive damage to glomeruli cause urine production to fall. Metabolic waste
products increases in the blood.

There are three main types of glomerulonephritis :

(1) Nephritic syndrome

(2) Nephrotic syndrome

(3) A symptomatic proteinuria and hematuria syndrome

Nephritis may also involve the blood vessels within the kidneys. Inflammation of
the blood vessels is called vasculitis.

1. Nephritic Syndrome

Nephritic syndrome is a disorder of glomeruli causing swelling (edema), high
blood pressure and the presence of red blood cells in the urine.
