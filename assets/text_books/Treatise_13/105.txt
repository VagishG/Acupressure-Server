Nephritis

e â€” When rapidly progressiv glomerulonephritis develops, weakness, fatigue &
fever are the most common early symptoms. Loss of appetite, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain and joint pain are also common.

e About 50% of people have an influenza like illness in month before kidney
failure started to develop. These people have edema and usually produce
very little urine. High blood pressure is rare.

Diagnosis

People who had strep throat or another infection, if they develop kidney symptoms,
it may be nephritic syndrome.

Laboratory tests show protein and blood cells in urine. There is a high concentration
of serum urea and creatinine in the blood.

To identify cause of nephritic syndrome a throat culture may provide evidence of
streptococeal infection.

Prognosis

Acute nephritic syndrome resolves completely in about 80% to 90% of chiledren
and about 60% of adults.

In some children & adults who do not recover completely from acute nephritic
syndrome, other types of kidney disorders develop such as asymptomatic
proteinuria and hematuria syndrome or nephrotic syndrome.

Other people with acute nephritic syndrome, especially older adults, develop
chronic nephritic syndrome.

Nephrotic Syndrome

Nephrotic Syndrome is a glomerular disorder characterised by severe loss of
protein in the urine, leading to accumulation of fluid (edema) and low levels of
albumin in the blood.

Details of symptoms, diagnosis & treatment of nephrotic syndrome are given ina
separate chapter in this book.

Asymptomatic Proteinuria and Hematuria Syndrome

It is a disorder of the glomeruli characterised steady or intermittent loss of small
amount of protein and blood in the urine.
