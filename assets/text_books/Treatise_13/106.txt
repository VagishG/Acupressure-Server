Nephritis

Most people with asymptomatic proteinuria and hematuria syndrome do not worsen
and the condition may persist indefinitely.

Treatment of nephritic syndrome

No specific treatment is available in most of the cases of nephritic syndrom.
Following a diet low in protein and sodium may be necessary until kidney function
recovers.

Diuretics may be prescribed to help the kidneys excrete excess sodium and water.
High blood pressure needs to be treated.

When a bacterial infection is suspected as the cause of acute nephritis syndrome,
antibiotics are usually ineffective because nephritis begin 1 to 6 weeks after the
infection.

For rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, drugs to suppress the immune system
are started promptly.

High doses of corticosteroids are usually given intravenously for about a week.
After that the reduced quantity of steroids is given orally.

If treatment is delayed, there is an increased likelyhood of kidney failure and the
need for dialysis.
