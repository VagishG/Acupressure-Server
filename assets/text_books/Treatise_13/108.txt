39 | Nephrotic Syndrome

Nephrotic syndrome is a non-inflammatory disease of the glomerulus that causes :

e Proteinuria

e Generalised tissue edema (swelling)

e — Hypoalbumineuria

e — Hyper cholesterolemia

Nephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms and signs caused by injury to the
kidney’s tiny filters which are called glomeruli.

The injury causes protein to abnormally leak out of blood and into the urine.

This lowers the level of albumin in the blood.

Albumin holds fluid in the blood vessels.

Low level of albumin in the blood causes fluid to leak out of blood vessels and into
the tissues, causing swelling.

Kidney can not excrete the excess salt in the urine, which in turn causes edema.

A high or low blood pressure can occur.

Nephrotic syndrome produce a far smaller amount of urine than normal.

Blood volume may be normal, reduced or increased.

There is increased level of fats (lipids) in blood.

There is a tendency for increased blood clotting and greater susceptibility to
infection.

Nephrotic syndrome may be of two types :

(1) Acute nephrotic syndrome, which develops suddenly or over a short period.

(2) Chronic nephrotic syndrome, which develops and progresses slowly.

In 1% children and 10% adults, the acute nephrotic syndrome evolves into rapidly
progressive glomerulo nephritis, in which most of the glomeruli are destroyed. It results
in kidney failure.

Nephrotic syndrome is more common in boys than girls. The disease may relapse
until the age of 20 years.
