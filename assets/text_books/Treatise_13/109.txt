Amount of protein & blood cells in the urine.
Protein and blood cells starts going in urine.

In urine sodium reduces but potassium increases.
Concentration of urea & creatinine in the blood.

In Nephrotic syndrome in blood, urea & creatinine & cholestrol (fats) increase;
patient's blood cells reduce & anemia takes place.

White blood cells increase abnormally.

Ratio of the level of urine protein & urine creatinine may help diagnose
nephrotic syndrome.

When nephrotic syndrome is suspected, a biopsy of kidneys is usually
performed to determine the amount of scarring & potential for reversibility.
A throat culture may provide evidence of streptococal infections.

If a person loses weight or is older, a search for cancer is done.

90% of children & 60% of adults suffering from nephrotic syndrome gets
cured completely.

In-about half of the people who are treated early within a few months, kidney
function is preserved & dialysis in not needed.

People suffering from progressive glomerulonephritis do not develop major
symptoms and hence do not seek medical care until kidney failure develops.
People with advanced kidney failure die within a few weeks unless they
undergo dialysis.

When the cause is unknown & the person is older, the prognosis is worse.
