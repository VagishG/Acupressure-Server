Know Your Kidneys

SSeS

The small veins veins join to form a single large renal vein.
The renal vein carries away the blood from each kidney.

Structure of kidney :
Kidney structure is of two types :
(1) Microscopic structure of the kidney.
(2) Gross structure of the kidney.

1. Microscopic structure of the kidney
Each kidney is composed of four types of microscopic structures.

(i)

Nephrons creative & active bodies

Nephrons are microscopic units which filter the blood and produce urine. Each
kidney contains about one million nephrons.

Each nephron has protein walls. This protein sends minerals, acid & from
nephron to capillaries & capillaries enable minerals, acids & nutrients to region
the blood stream.

Glomeruli

Each nephron consists of a glomerulus. It is important functioning unit of kidney.
The initial filtering is done by a million tiny glomeruli. In each glomeruli, there
are tiny capillaries.

Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries which filter excess fluid and waste substances
from the blood. The cells & proteins in the blood stay inside the blood vessels
and are not filtered out.

(iii) There are a smaller number of collecting tubules.

Each glomerulus is surrounded by a thin walled tiny tube called tubule which
drains fluid from a space in Bowmanâ€™s capsule.

It is in these tubules that the kidneys regulate the fluid, mineral & acid base
balance of the body. If the tubules receive signals that the body needs more of
a substance they reclaim these substances from the urine back into the blood
stream.

Thus the tubules reclaim the fluid minerals or acid etc. as & when needed.

(iv) A collecting duct that drains urine.

The fluid becomes urine by the time it reaches the collecting ducts.
