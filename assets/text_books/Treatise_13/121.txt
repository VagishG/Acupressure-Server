Hydronephrosis may cause urine obstruction and acute renal failure.

Urinary obstruction may produce crampy pain, usually along the sides (flanks)
of the body. Some people with hydronephrosis have blood in their urine.

If the obstruction is located below the bladder, the bladder will enlarge.

Diagnosis of Acute Kidney Failure

(i) Blood tests that measure levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in the blood
are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

(ii) A progressive daily rise in creatinine indicates acute kidney failure.

(iii) Higher the level of creatinine, the more severe the failure is likely to be.

(iv) Ahigh acid level (acidosis), a high potassium level (hyperkalemia), a low sodium
level (hyponatremia), a high phosphorus level (hyperphosphatemia) are metabolic
imbalances that occurs as kidney failure persists.
