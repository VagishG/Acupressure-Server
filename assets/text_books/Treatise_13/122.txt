Kidney Failure or Renal Failure

(v) Urine tests, such as urine analysis and a measurement of certain electrolytes
help diagnose the cause of the kidney failure.
Passing of albumin in the urine indicates kidney trouble.

(vi) Ultrasound & CT Scan is helpful in knowing the size of kidneys.

(vil) An ultrasound can be used to identify hydronephrosis.
Ultrasound can also be used to detect an enlarged bladder.

(viii) Angiography may be performed if obstruction of blood vessels is the suspected
causes.

(ix) A biopsy may be necessary to determine the diagnosis and the prognosis.

Prognosis & treatment
Forecast of any ailment's expected time of expiry or patient's chance of death
called prognosis.
Acute kidney failure and its complication, such as fluid retention, high acid and
potassium level in the blood, and increased level of urea in the blood can often be
treated succesfully.
The overall survival rate is about 60%.
Patient's weight is measured everyday to moniter fluid intake.
A weight gain from one day to the next indicates that the person is receiving
excess fluid.
Water intake is restricted to replacing the amount lost from the body.
A person with acute kidney failure is given amino acids (protein) by mouth or
intravenously to maintain adequate protein levels.
Sodium salts and potassium intake is usually restricted.
Acute kidney failure may be prolonged, necessitating that waste products and
excess water be removed through dialysis, usually hemodialysis.
Dialysis may be needed only temporarily, untill the kidneys recover their function,
usually in several days to several weeks.
If the kidneys are badly damaged to recover, then the acute kidney failure will
become chronic kidney failure.
