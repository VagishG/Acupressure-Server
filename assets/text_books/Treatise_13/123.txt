Kidney Failure or Renal Failure

Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)

Itis progressive loss of kidney function that develops over many months or years.

Acute kidney failure can become chronic, if kidney function does not recover

after treatment.

Causes of kidney failure

(i) Most common cause of chronic kidney failure is uncontrolled diabetes
mellitus.

(ii) Uncontrolled high blood pressure causes CRF.

(iii) Diabetes & high B.P. directly harm the kidney's small blood vessels.

(iv) Other causes of CRF include :

(a) Urinary tract obstruction

(b) Kidney abnormalities such as polycystic kidney disease and
glomerulonephritis.

(c) Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, in
which antibodies damage the smallest blood vessels (glomeruli) and
tiny tube (tubules) of the kidneys.

(v) Excessive use of several drugs e.g. pain killers may cause CRF.
(vi) Long term exposure to mercury or lead may cause CRF.

End Stage Kidney Failure

Chronic kidney failure may lead to end stage kidney failure, when the kidney
function goes below 10% of normal.

Now kidney can no longer remove waste from the body.

Now dialysis or a kidney transplant may be needed.

End stage kidney failure is called uraemia Due to kidney failure wastes are
in creased in blood.

End stage kidney failure's main cause is diabetes mellitus.

Main Symptoms

(i) A person with mild kidney failure may have only mild symptoms despite the
increase in levels of urea and other metabolic waste products in the blood.
