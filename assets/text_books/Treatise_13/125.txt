At this stage, the person may need to urinate several times during the night. It is
called nocturia.

Itis also because the kidneys can not absorb water from the urine.

As the kidney failure progresses and metabolic wastes build up in the blood, the
patient may feel fatigued.

These symptoms progress as the blood becomes more acidic. This is called
acidosis a loss of appetite and shortness of breath can result.

Fatigue & generalised weakness may also be caused by a decline in red blood
Production and the resulting anemia.

People with chronic kidney failure may bruise easily or bleed for an unusually
long time after cuts or injuries.

CRF also diminishes the body's ability to fight infections.

As metabolic wastes build up in the blood, there may be damage to the muscles
& nerves. It can cause muscle twitches muscle weakness, cramps & pain.
There may be pins & needis__ sensation in the arms & legs. It may also cause
loss of sensation in certain areas of the body.

Ultimately encephalopathy, a condition in which the brain malfunctions, may be
caused. This condition may lead to seizures, lethargy and confusion.

High B.P. often develops in CRF, because the diseased kidneys produce hormone
that raise high blood pressure.

In CRF kidneys cannot excrete excess salts & water. Salt & fluid retention can
lead to heart failure. This may cause shortness of breath.

The pericardium becomes inflammed (pericarditis) as metabolic waste products
accumulate. This can cause chest pain, and low blood pressure.

The levels of triglycerides in the blood is often increased which, alongwith high
blood pressure, increase the risk of arterialsclerosis.

The increase of level of metabolic wastes in the blood also causes nausea, vomiting
& unpleasant taste in the mouth. This may ultimately cause malnutrition and
weight loss.
