Kidney Failure or Renal Failure

(xv) People who have advanced chronic kidney failure commonly develop gastro
intestinal ulcers & bleeding. The skin may become yellow-brown.

The concentration of urea is so high that it crystalises from sweat forming a white
powder on skin.

(xvi) Some people with CRF itch all over their body.

(xvii) The formation and maintenance of bone tissue may be impaired. It is called
osteodystrophy. This may be due to a high level of parathyroid hormone, low
calcitrol (the active form of vitamin D) in the blood. It impairs absorption of calcium
and a level of phosphate in the blood.

Renal osteodystrophy may lead to bone pain and an increased risk of fractures.

(xviii) If due to CRF potassium increases in blood, then cardiac arrest may occur.

(xix) Kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin. This hormone stimulates
creation of red blood cells. In CRF this hormone's production stops causing red
blood cells production reducing & it causes patient's anemia.

Diagnosis of CRF
To ascertain kidney function, first blood & urine test are done :

1. Blood tests are essential & show increased levels of blood urea, creatinine,
metabolic waste products that are normally filtered out by the kidneys :

(a)

()

The blood becomes more acidic.

The levels of potassium in the blood is normal or only slightly increased it
can be dangerously high in case of advanced CRF or if a person ingests
large amounts of potassium.

The patient has decline in red blood cells counts (anemia).

The level of triglycerides in the blood is likely to be elevated.
The calcium and calcitriol levels decrease.

The phosphate and parathyroids hormone levels are increased.

2. â€” Analysis of urine may detect many abnormalities :

(a) With urine albumin comes out.
(b) With urine other abnormal cells may also come out.
