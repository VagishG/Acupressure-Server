Kidney Failure or Renal Failure

3. Determining a precise cause of CRF becomes difficult as the kidney failure reaches
an advanced stage.
4. Akidney biopsy may be most accurate test.

Biopsy is not advised, if results of an ultrasound show that the kidneys are small
or scarred.

Prognosis & treatment of CRF

(i) | CRF progresses in most people regardless of treatment.

(ii) It is fatal if not treated.

(ii) When the CRF is severe. It is called end stage kidney failure. The life expectancy
is usually limited to several months, if not treated properly.
Those who are treated with dialysis can live many years.

(iv) Infection are treated promptly with antibiotics by allopaths.

(v) Any obstruction in urinary tract is removed promptly or relieved.

(vi) Controlling the level of sugar in the blood and the high blood pressure slows the
deterioration in kidney function.

(vii) Mild acidosis can be controlled by increasing in the intake of carbohydrates &
reducing proteins.

(viii) Moderate or severe acidosis may require treatment with sodium bicarbonate.

(ix) The decline in kidney function can be slightly slowed by reducing protein
consumption.

(x) The person needs to consume sufficient carbohydrates to offset the reduction in
protein.

(xi) The triglyceride level may be reduced by limiting fat in the diet.

(xii) The intake of sodium salt usually does not have to be restricted unless fluid
accumulates & is retaining in the tissues.

If the patient has high blood pressure also, reduce the intake of sodium salt. A
person with heart failure needs to restrict the intake of sodium.

(xiii) Diuretics may also relieve symptoms of heart failure.

(xiv) Water intake needs to be restricted to prevent the sodium concentration in the
blood from becoming too low.
