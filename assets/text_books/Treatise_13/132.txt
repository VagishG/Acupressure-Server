Dialysis

Dialysis may also be used as an interim measure before kidney transplanation.

Kidney removes waste substances & excess fluids thorough the medium of urine

and in so doing. Kidney balances the quantity of fluids, acid & minerals in the

body.

When kidney fails, the above process of filteration stops & therefore dialysis is

done. Dialysis is done through the dialysis machine which cleans the blood which

was otherwise being done by the kidney.

There are two types of dialysis :

(1) Hemodialysis

(2) Peritonial dialysis

Hemodialysis

(i) It is performed in a hospital or in an out patient clinic.

(ii) _ In this, blood is taken out from the artery of the hand, leg or near the neck &
after filteration is resent to the body.

(iii) For this process, a shunt is applied by an intravenous catheter or a fistula is
mode.

(iv) Shunt is a tube made of plastic, which has two ends. One end is attached to
the artery below the skin & the other is attached to the vein.

(v) Hemodialysis removes blood through an artery in the arm or the leg. It
cleanses the blood of impurities and returns the blood to the body.

(vi) Both the catheter used for emergency dialysis and the shunt used for long
term dialysis can become infected.
This infection is promptly treated with antibiotics.
If the treatment is unsuccessful or if a clot blocks the catheter or shunt, the
device must be replaced.

(vii) Before hemodialysis, the access area in the arms or leg is cleaned and two

needles are inserted. One needle carry the blood to the dialysis machine

and another needle that will carry the cleansed blood back to the body.

Most people undergo dialysis 3 times a week. Each dialysis takes about 4

hours time.
