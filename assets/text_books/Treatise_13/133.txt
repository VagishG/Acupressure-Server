Dialysis

(ix) When dialysis is taking place, the patient sits still while his blood stream is
connected temporarily to the machine. But the patient is fully conscious
and can read, watch TV or listen to radio.

(x) After dialysis, the machine is disconnected and the patient is allowed to go
home.

Peritoneal dialysis

It is simpler procedure. It is usually performed at patients home.

In peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum acts as a filter.

Peritoneum is a space formed by the inner lining of the abdominal wall.

This peritoneum has a large surface area and a rich network of blood vessels.
The peritoneum is filled with a cleansing solution called dialsate.

The solution enters the peritoneal space via a catheter which passes through the
abdominal wall.

To implant the catheter, a small incision is made in the abdomen under local
anesthesia.

Abag containing dialysate is attached to the catheter. The fluid is allowed to drain
into the peritoneal space with the help of gravity.

Abag is then disconnected and the patient can do their usual activities, while the
cleansing solution stays in their abdomen.

The cleansing solution is allowed to remain there for 4 hours. During these 4
hours the cleansing solution absorbs the toxins directly from the tiny blood vessels.
After 4 hours, the fluid in the peritoneal space is drained back into the empty bag
through the catheter.

Each exchange takes about an hour and is performed 4 times a day. This process
is done on all seven days a week.

This types of dialysis is called continuous peritoneal dialysis.

Comparision of hemodialysis & peritoneal dialysis :

Hemodialysis requries the pateint to go to a hospital or an out patient clinic for
treatment.

Hemodialysis involves only 12 hours of dialysis per week.
