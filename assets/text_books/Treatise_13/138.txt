tuns through the prostate.

An enlarged prostate may block the flow of urine from the urinary bladder by
narrowing the urethra.

The prostate gland and the seminal vesicles produce fluid which nourishes sperm.
This fluid is thin and slightly alkaline.

This fluid provides most of the volume of semen, the secretion in which the sperm
is expelled during ejaculation.

After the age of 60 years, this fluid sometimes gets expelled with urine in a while
& form is prostratic fluid. This is a normal both activities & is not a disease.
