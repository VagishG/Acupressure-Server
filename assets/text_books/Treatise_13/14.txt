Formation of Urine

Thus, lot of blood start felting increases excessively, then filtered, hence in
kidney failure cases, blood pressure diabetes should be control.

When the blood pressure falls below 80 mm./Hg. in case of severe shock the
hydrostalic pressure in nephron fall & unpairs the function of nephrons.

2. Selective Reabsorption :

Glucose

Amino acids

Sodium

Calcium

Potassium

e Phosphate

e Chloride ions

There are reabsorbed by the body :

Regulation of reabsorption :

(a) Reabsorption is regulated by body's need for them at that time in order to
maintain homeostasis.

Homeostasis means stability in the normal physiological stage.
(b) Reabsorption is regulated by hormones also.

(i) | Parathromone from parathyroid gland and calcitonin from thyroid gland,
together regulates reabsorption of calcium & phosphate.

(ii) Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from posterior lobe of pitutary gland increase
the permeability and increases reabsorption.

(iii) Aldosterone secreted by cortex of adrenal gland. increases reabsorption
of sodium & excretion of potassium.
3. Secretion
Despute filteration by Glomerules some unwanted substances & drug remain in
the blood. Such substances are secreted by the kidneys.
