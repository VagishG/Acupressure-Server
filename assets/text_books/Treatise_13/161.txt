Know Your Kidneys

Glomerular feilteration rate (GFR) :

The rate at which the blood is filtered is called glomerular filteration rate (GFR).
GFR helps in assessing how efficiently the kidneys are functioning.

The fluid & waste filtered out in the glomeruli then goes to pelvis via a series of
tubules. Renal pelvis is central collecting region.

2. Gross structure of the kidney :

Naked eyes see three regions kidneys.

(i) Capsule of kidney.

(ii) Cortex of kidney.

(iii) Medulla of kidney.

(i) Capsules of kidney :
The outer part of kidney is called capsule. It is a fibrous capsule, surrounding
the kidney. Kidney is inside the capsule.

(ii) Cortex of kidney :
It is reddish brown layer of tissue under the capsule and between pyramids.
This is the upper part of kidney capsuleâ€™s cortex.

(iii) Renal medulla of kidney (Treatment point K 2a) :
It is the inner most layer of kidney consisting of renal pyramids.
All the glomeruli are located in the cortex. Hence, treatment of cortex and
glomeruli is to be given on K 3b.

The tubules reside both in cortex and the medulla. Hence, treatment of tubules
is to be given on k 3b & K 2a.

Hilum of kidney (Treatment point K 1 chinese) :

It is the medical border of kidney, where the renal blood & lymph vessels and
nerves enter the kidney.

The correct kidney eccentric, treat at K1 chinese.

Renal pelvis (Treatment point K 1 (Dr. Voll.) :
