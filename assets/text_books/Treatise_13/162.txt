(Scanty or Absence of Urination)

; 9 | Oliguria & Anuria

a)

(a)

Anuria means absence of urine formation by the kidneys.
Very little urine production is called oliguria.

No urine production is called anuria.

Normal volume of urine should be 1 litre to 1% litres per day.

On a normal diet, a minimum of 300 to 500 ml per day of urine is required to
excrete the solute load at maximum concentration.

It means that minimum 300 to 500 ml of urine must be excreted by the kidney to
excrete the wastes.

Volume of urine below 300 ml are termed oliguria
Anuria is almost total absence of urine < 50 mi/day
A low urine volume may be caused by :

(a) Reduced urine production

(b) Obstruction to urine flow

(c) Botha+b

Reduced Urine Production

(i) | The volume of urine produced by kidney is the difference between glomerular
filtration and tubular reabsorption.

Volume of urine produced = algqmeviarfilteration = tubwarreahsorotion...
(ii) Urine volumes are variable in renal failure.
(ili) Oliguria or anuria may be caused by a reduction in urine production.
(iv) It may happen in pre acute renal failure.
(v) When GFR (glumerular filteration rate) is very low, urine volumes may still
be normal if reabsorption is also low.
(vi) When GFR is reduced but reabsorption is intact or more, the volume of
urine produced is too low.

(vii) It causes oliguria or anuria. This happens in pre acute renal failure condition
due to intrinsic renal disease when GFR is reduced and reabsorption is
more to conserve salt & water.

(viii) A high urine volume may be caused by tubular reabsorption dysfunction.
(ix) Renal infarction may cause sudden cessation of urine production.
