Oliguria & Anuria (Scanty or Absence of Urination)

Chronic obstruction
Chronic obstruction does not produce pain but may produce dull ache.

Complete obstruction

To produce oliguria or anuria, the obstruction must be complete, must be bilateral

and must be distal to the bladder neck if the obstruction is not relieved promptly,

there will be backward pressure of urine which will damage the filteration process

in kidney.

Hence, timely diagnosis of oliguria & anuria is very important.

(a) Ultrasound should be undertaken urgently to identify obstruction.

(b) The therapists should know that if there is failure of urine production due to
renal failure, urinary tract wil; not be dilated.

(c) Anacute obstruction is to be relieved promptly & urgently by the renal function
may return to normal.

Partial obstruction

In partial urinary tract obstruction, there may be normal or high urine volume. It
may be due to chronic tubular injury.
