Know Your Kidneys

Aperistaltic wav of contraction of smooth muscle originates in pace maker cells in
the walls of calyces [(Treatment point for calyces is K 2 (Dr. Voll.)]

Kidneyâ€™s main & helping calyces are cup shaped.

This peristaltic wave propels urine through the pelvis & ureter to the bladder.
This is intrinsic function not under nerve control.

Renal pelvis has a number of branches called calyces.

Urine is formed in kidney.

It passes through a papilla (nipple) at the head of pyramid (K 2) into minor calyx.
Then it goes to ureter through pelvis.

Treat Hydronephrosis at K1 (Dr. Voll.)
