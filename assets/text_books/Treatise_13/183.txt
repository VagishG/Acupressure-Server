3 | Know Your Ureters, Bladder & Urethera

Urine produced by the two kidneys is collected via the ureters in the urinary bladder
and is then removed only the body from the bladder via the urethra.

There are two ureters connected to the two kidneys. Each ureter is about 16 inch
long and its upper part is connected to the urine produced by the kidneys comes to the
urinary bladder via the ureters.

Ureters are composed of smooth muscles which contract in rhythmic waves to
push urine towards urinary bladder.

At the urinary bladder, each ureter passes through a sphincter.

The sphincter is a circular muscular structure which opens to allow the urine to
come in the bladder and them closes tightly.

Urinary Bladder

Urinary bladder is an expanding bag in which urine keeps collecting and as urine
quantity increases, the bag keeps expanding. The bladder has two gates; the first is
for entry of urine from kidney and the other is for exit of urine to outside. Both the
gates have sphincters.

When the bladder is completely full its nerves inform the brain that there is to
urinate then the brain creates a urge to urinate & the person urinates. During urination,
sphincter as the outside gate opens & the urine flows out during which the bladder
keeps contracting and increased pressure in the urether makes urine to flow out in a
stream. During urination the upper gate of bladder through which urine enters the bladder
is tightly shut urine is unable flow back to the kidney.

Upto 400 mililitre urine can be collected in the bladder.

Urethera

Urethera is a tube which lets the urine to flow only the body. It is about 8 inch long
in males and it goes upto the tip of the panis. In females, the urethera is 1% inch long
and it goes upto the vulva. Since the urethera is very short in females, they have
greater chance of getting urinary tract infection.
