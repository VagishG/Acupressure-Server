Bed Wetting

2. â€” Reduce intake of fluids before bed times.
Urinate before going to bed.
Some children benefit by being awakened every few hours during the night to
pass urine.

5. Place a liquid sensitive pad between the mattress and bed sheet. The pad sounds
an alarm when wet. This effective method teaches child to awaken as urine is
passed. In India a plastic sheet is placed on the bed so that the bed is not spoiled
but the child gets up as it becomes wet & so he realises that he should not urinate
on the bed. This results in reduction in bed wetting.
