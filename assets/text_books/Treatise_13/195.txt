Important notes

1.

The patient should avoid drinking fluids in the evening & should be awakened at
fixed times to use the toilet.

The patient should be encouraged to overcome emotional factors like nervousness
and fear.

If enuresis is related to some other functional disorder, this must be treated as
well.

Several protocols have been given above for treatment of Bed wetting. The
therapists should select a protocol based on symptoms & need.

Our assessment is that by treatment of acupresure, 80% bed wetting cases will
be cured.
