See the leakages with Urine and treat the Urinary Diseases

We thus see that in any urinary tract ailment, there can be any of seven leakages
in urine, sometimes, there is gravel in urine. Sometimes there is blood in urine,
sometimes greasy protein leakage in urine & sometimes pus comes out with urine.
This pus sometimes is white & sometimes red. Sometimes a patient feels extremely
tired after urination & sometimes the patient is unable to urinate. if there is gravel in
urine then there are chances of stone forming in urinary tract; treatment given at para
(3) above can correct stone formation. If pus comes out with urine then it can be due to
infection of genorrhoea. Treatment given at para6 above can correct genorrhoea &
other internal diseases & urine can become clear. if there is red pus in urine, then it can
be due to infection in blood, so treatment at para 7 above can purify blood & clear
urine will be feasible. If there is retention of urine or heaviness & pain in pelvic floor,then
treatment at para 1 can correct the problem. In this the main symptom is heaviness &
pain at pelvic floor. Hence, therapists should identify the seven urinary ailments and
apply the correct treatment.
