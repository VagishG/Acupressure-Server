2 | Know Your Kidneys

There are two kidneys, one in the left side of the body and the other in the right side
of the body.

The kidney in the left side of the body is called left kidney & the kidney in the right
side of the body is called right kidney.

Location of kidneys :

The two kidneys are located on the right to the left spine column between the 3rd
lumbar vertebrae.The right kidney is slightly at lower level than the left kidney. This is
because the liver occupies more space on the right side.

Shape & size of kidney :
Kidneys are bean shaped organs.
size of each kidney is about 11cm long, 6 cm. wide & 3 cm. thick.
Weight of each kidney is about 150 gms.

Blood filtering in kidneys

About 125 ml per minute i.e. 180 ltrs. of blood is filtered each day by the two
kidneys.

The body has a total of 5.5 litres blood and the kidneys filter the entire blood 32
times daily.

Of the 180 Itrs. of blood filtered each day, 1 to 1.5 Itr. isd excreted as urine.

178.5 Itrs. of blood & fluids are reabsorbed.

From aorta blood flows into each kidney through renal artery. Renal is a medical
term used to refer to kidneys.

Blood flows from the renal artery into progressively smaller arteries, the smallest
being arterioles inside each kidney.

From arterioles, the blood flows into glomeruli.

Glomuruli are tufts of microscopic vessels that are called capillaries.

Blood exits each glomerulus through another arteriole, which connects to a small
vein.
