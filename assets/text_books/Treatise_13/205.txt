4 | Effects of Ageing on Urinary System

In old age, there is slow & steady decline in the weight of kidneys.

After the age of 40 years, about 67% of people face a gradual decline in the rate at
which the kidneys filter blood. About 33% people have no reduction in filtration of blood
by the kidneys.

Despite age related changes, sufficient kidney functions is preserved to meet the
needs of the body.

With ageing, the maximum volume of urine which the urinary bladder can hold
decreases.

Apersonâ€™s ability to delay urination after first sensing a need to urinate also declines.
This is called incontinence of urine.

The rate of urine flow from bladder and to urethra slows.

There is an increases in the amount of urine which remain in the urinary bladder
after urination. This is called retention of urine.

In women the urethra shortens and its lining becomes thinner. This causes inability
of the urinary sphincter to close tightly. It results in dribbling of urine before or after
urination.

The changes in the woman's urethra is caused by a declining level of estrogen
during menopause.

Hence, during and after menopause, female's power of retention of urine reduces
and so secretion of estrogen hormone should be increased to enable urine-
retentionability.

People eating less sodium ensure complete functioning of kidnap even during old
age.
