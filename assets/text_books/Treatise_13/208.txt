TCM protocols for treatment of kidney disease

"When the kidneys are in excess one dreams that the spine is detached from the

body. When they are weak, one dreams of being immersed in water.

â€œChapter 43 of the Spiritual Axis"
Kidneys are controllers of various Human Activities :
Kidneys control the following human activities :

Kidneys control the opening & closing of the two lower orifices viz
Anus and Urethra
(a) Urethra:
If Kidney yang is deficient, then the urine gate opens out & excessive urination
takes place.
If kidney yin is deficient, urine gate closes and urine is reduced and is turbid.
(b) Anus
If kidney yang is deficient, then diaorrhea may occur.

If kidney yang is in excess, constipation may occur. But actually kidney
yang excess is quite rare.

Kidneys control skill & strength :

If kidneys are strong, then the person can perform purposeful & hard work for
long periods.

If kidney is weak, then the person does not have the ability to perform hard work
& for long periods.

An opposed to this, sometimes kidney disharmony makes the person work alcholic
to work for beyond his ability.

The kidney also affects a person capacity in his skill & delicate activities.

The Kidneys are the root of preheaven Qi :

(a) Spleenis the root of post heaven Qi. Post heaven Qiis Qi and blood produced
after birth.

(b) Kidneys are the root of preheaven Qi because kidneys store life essence
which the person inherits from his, parents from God as 'prarabdh.'
