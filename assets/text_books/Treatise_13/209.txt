TCM protocols for treatment of kidney disease

4. The Kidney do not like Dryness :

(b) Internal dryness can be from the following causes :
(i) | Stomach deficiency;
(ii) Continuous sweating;
(iii) Diarrhoea
(iv) Smoking; tobacco dries blood and life essence and weakness kidney
yin
(c) Lungs dislike cold
(d) Kidneys dislike excessive cold
(e) Lungs dislike excessive dryness

5. The kidneys are the gate of the stomach :
If kidneys are unable to properly expel fluids, then obstructed fluids affect the
stomach.
And if there is dificiency of fluids in the stomach, then kidney yin becomes deficient.
Hence stomach & kidneys are interdependent; one takes fluids and the other
expels them from the body. Both function the receipt & expulsion of fluids & so
kidney is called the gate of the stomach.
