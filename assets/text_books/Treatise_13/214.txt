Causes of Disease

Deficiency of kidney yang results in reduction of body heat, back & knees
become cold and the patient dislikes cold. In sexual energy also he feels cold.
When kidney yang becomes Deficient, transformation of fluids does not take
place and all the water & fluids that have been taken flow out as urine; when
kidney yang becomes so deficient that the body is unable to throw out the
fluids in the form of urine, then they get collected under the skin and odoema
occurs in the legs; the tongue also becomes swollen. Tongue's swelling indicates
that under the skin water retention has taken place and so to eradicate this
swelling, treatment of kidney yang deficiency should be done.
