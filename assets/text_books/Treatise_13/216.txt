5 | Functions of Kidneys

All of the functions normally performed by two kidneys can be carried out adequately

by one healthy kidney.
Kidneys perform following important functions in the human body.

1. To keep the right amount of :
(a) Water
(b) Minerals (Sodium, Calcium, Phosphate, Potassium, Choride, lons etc.)
(c) Nutrients
(d) Acids (amino acids) in the body

2. To remove waste products such as blood urea, creatinine, uric acid, excess ions,
some drugs, sugar etc. through urine.

3. To take back into blood just what the body needs. Rest in excreted in urine.

4, Homeostasis of the body is maintained by kidneys. Hoemostasis is state of
equilibrium in the body.

5. Electrolyte balance of the body is maintained by kidneys.
Electrolyte : It is a compound capable of resolution by electrolysis.

6. Acid base balance is influenced by the kidneys by excretion of hydrogen ions.

7. Kidneys make hormone renin.
Renin increases blood pressure, when the kidney senses that the blood pressure
is too low or the sodium level is too low.
Renin is an enzyme found only in kidney cotex (Treatment point K3 Dr. Voll.)
Another function of the kidneys is to help regulate the bodyâ€™s blood pressure by
excreting excess sodium, if too little sodium is excreted, the blood pressure is
likely to increase. Aperson with kidney failure is less able to regulate blood pressure
and tends to have high blood pressure.

8. Kidneys make hormone erythropoietin.
Erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells.
