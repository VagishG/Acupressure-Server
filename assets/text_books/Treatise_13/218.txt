Causes of Disease

Therapists should know that kidney controls the process of inhalation (breathing)
and lungs control the exhalation. Both complete the cycle of breathing. When
there is disharmony betweenthe lungs & kidney, then there is obstruction in
the process of inhalation & exhalation and the person becomes a patient of
asthma; this happens due to kidney yang & Qi deficiencies. Lungs send energy
downwards & kidney stops it there. When kidney is unable to stop it downwards,
then energy gets blocked in upper part of the body & this causes obstruction in
breathing. The following formulae for treatment should be remembered.

e Lungs control exhalation

e Kidney controls inhalation

e Lungs controls oedema of the upper half of body

e Kidney Control oedema of lower half of the body
e In oedema of face, lungs is also involved.
