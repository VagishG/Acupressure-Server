bone marrow then releases the red blood cells into the blood stream (Treatment
point K 3 for kidney & GB 39 for bone marrow).

Kidneys make hormone angiotenini. When there is shortage of water in the body,
kidney senses it first of all. It makes hormone angiotenin & secretes it in the blood
stream to send an S.0.S. message to hypothalamus in the brain. Hypothalamus
makes anti diuretic hormone (ADH). The water is reabsorbed in the blood & creation
of urine is suspended.

Any fluid one drinks, is absorbed into the blood and increases the total volume of
blood in circulation.

When the blood volume is higher than normal, the kidneys respond by eliminating
more fluid in urine.

Growth and maintenance of healthy bones is a complex process that depends on
several organ systems of the body, including the kidneys.

The kidneys helps regulate levels of calcium and phosphorus, the minerals that
are critical to bone health. They do so by converting an inactive from of vitamin D
{a type of hormone), which is produced in the skin and is also present in many
foods, to an active form of vitamin D (a type of hormone), which is produced in the
skin and is also present in many foods, to an active form of vitamin D (calcitriol).
Calcitriol then stimulates absorption of calcium & phosphorus from the small
intestines.

All the functions normally performed by two kidneys can be done adequately by
one healthy kidney.

Some people are born with only one kidney and some people choose to donate
one kidney.

Hence, we see that the primary functions of the kidneys are to filter the blood and
eliminate metabolic waste products and excess and excess water and electrolytes.
In addition many drugs are excreted.
