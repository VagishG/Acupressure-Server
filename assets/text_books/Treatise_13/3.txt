6 | Formation of Urine

There are three phases of formation of urine :
(1) Simple filteration of blood

(2) Selective reabsorption

(3) Secretion

. Simple filteration of blood
Glomeruli's semipermeable walls enable simple filteration of blood.

Permeability :

The ability of cell membrances to allow salts, glucose, urea & other soluble
substances to pass into & out of cells from the body fluids.

Semipermeability

The cell membrance which is permeable to some substance in solution but not to
others.

By simple filteration of blood water & small molecules are filtered out though some
are reabsorbed later.

Blood cells, plasma protein & large molecules do not get filtered out and remain
back in the capillaries pressure is required to enable filteration.

Diameter of the afferent arteriole is more.

Diameter of the afferent arteriole is less.

Hence, a capillary hydrostatic pressure builds up.

This pressure becomes 55 mm. Hg.

The osmatic pressure of blood is 30 mm. Hg.

Glomerular capsule is resistance is about 15 mm. Hg.

Net filteration = pressure :

55 â€” (30 + 15) = 10 mm/Hg.

Hence, 10 mm./Hg. net filteration pressure ensures filteration from glomerules.

If a patient's blood pressure increases excessively, then net filteration pressure
also increases excessively.
