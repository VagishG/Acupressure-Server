33 | Hydronephrosis

This is formed from two words : Hydro + nephrosis
Hydro means water & Nephrosis means any Non inflammatory disease of kidneys.
Hydronephrosis is dilation of the kidney with urine.
It is caused by backward pressure on the kidney, when the flow of the urine is
obstructed.
How is Hydronephrosis caused?

1. Normally, urine from the Kidney comes out at very low pressure.

2. _ If flow of urine is obstructed, then urine returns back to kidney tubes & to Renal
pelvis. This causes kidney to swell & pressure increases in kidney’s internal
structure.

3. This pressure ultimately damages the kidney and its functioning stops.

4, When renal pelvis & ureter remainfull with urine then their muscles of
thythmic contraction stops. This muscles’ rhythmic contraction causes urine to
flow to the bladder & ureter walls get scar tissues & their is permanent damage.

Causes of hydronephrosis
When there is some obstruction at the function of renal pelvis & ureter then
hydronephrosis results. This obstruction may be due to the following causes :
1. Structural abnormaiities.
This happens when ureter is attached above the renal pelvis this is from birth.
2. — Twisting at the junction.
It results from kidney shifting downwards.
3. Stones in the renal pelvis.
4. Compression of the ureter by :
(a) Fibrous tissues
(b) An abnormally located artery
(c) An abnormally located vein
(d) Atumor
