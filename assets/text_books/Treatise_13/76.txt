Hydronephrosis

When there is some obstruction below the junction of renal pelvis & ureter or
when urine back flows from urinary bladder, then also hydronephrosis can be due to the
following causes -

(1) Stone in ureter
(2) Tumor in ureter
(3) Narrowing of ureter due to :
(a) Accongenital defect
(b) An injury
(c) An injection
(d) Radiation therapy
(e) Surgery
(4) Disorders of muscles or nerves in ureter or bladder.
(5) Prostrate enlargement which prevents flow of urine from bladder to urethra.
(6) Abnormal contraction of bladder due to :
(a) A brith defect
(b) An injury
Hydronephrosis of both kidney can occur during pregnancy.
During pregnancy, uterus increases & when it starts pressing the uretersthen urine
gets obstructed & back flows. This causes hydronephrosis of both kidneys. After delivery,
this type of hydronephrosis automatically is rectified. But sometimes even after delivery
distention in renal pelvis & ureter remains and this has to be treated.
