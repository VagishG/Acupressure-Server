Hydronephrosis

Diagnosis of hydronephrosis
Early diagnosis is important.
Obstruction can be corrected, if detected early.

Treatment
In acute hydronephrosis :

(1) Urine has accumulated above the obstruction. This accumulated urine is to
be drained as soon as possible to prevent loss of kidney function.

A needle is inserted through the skin into the kidney to suck the urine.
(2) The obstruction is also to be relieved quickly.
If there is stone, immediate surgery may be needed.
(3) Complications of acute hydronephrosis are :
(a) Urinary tract infections
(b) Kidney failure
Both are to be treated promptly
In chronic hydronephrosis :
1. Urgent treatment is not required.

2. Chronic hydronephrosis is corrected by draining urine above the obstruction.
Ureteral stents may be inserted into the ureter to bypass an obstruction.
