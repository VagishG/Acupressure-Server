Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Diseases by Urine Testing

(i) Inflammation of kidney

(ii) Nephrotic syndrome, a defect in kidney filteration

(iii) Protein in urine also occurs when kidney function is declining due to diabetes
or persistent high blood pressure.

Protein are not usually found in urine because they are large molecules, which

normally stay in the blood and are not passed in the urine.

If the kidney filtering system is damaged, protein may pass in urine. If very small

quantity of protein is found in urine, the urine report will indicate Albuminâ€™, if more

albumin comes then Albumin* is written. Similarly, when more albumin comes out,

then +++ or ++++ is written. The more albumin is found in urine, it is indicative of

inner problem in kidney.

5. Presence of ketones in the urine of diabetics indicates that level of hormone, insulin
is too low. Ketones are small molecules. When one does not eat for several hours,
ketones accumulate in the blood & urine.

6. In the people who have kidney stones the levels of uric acid, calcium, oxalate and
sodium are often higher in the urine.

7. Kidney function is often evaluated by measuring blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and
creatine in the blood. When the kidney function declines, sufficienct BUN and
creatinine are not filtered in the urine. Hence, the urine of such persons do not
contain BUN & creatinine. Higher level of both of these are found in blood. When
kidney functioning reduces, kidney is unable to filter urea nitrogen & creatinine so
these two increase in blood & reduce in urine.

8. The blood is not usually found in the urine.

Presence of blood or R.B.C. in urine can indicate :
(i) Kidney stones

(ii) Urinary tract infection

(iii) Tumors of the urinary tract

(iv) Other problems like nephritis

9. Elevated levels of calcium in the urine can indicate.
(i) Kidney stones formed of calcium
(ii) Disorders of parathyroid gland
