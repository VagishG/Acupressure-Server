56 | Urinary Tract Stones

What is stone?

Stones are hard masses which form anywhere in the urinary tract.

Why the stones are formed?

Stones are formed because the urine becomes too saturated with salts that can
form stones. Stones form because the urine lacks the normal inhibitors of stone
formation.

Citrate is an inhibitor of stone formation, as it normally binds with calcium.

Calcium is often involved in formation of stone. About 80% of the stones are
composed of calcium.

Kidney stone formation tendency runs in families.

People living in hot climate are more often affected with kidney stone, due to
dehydration caused by perspiration. Urine becomes more concentrated. It causes kidney
stone.
