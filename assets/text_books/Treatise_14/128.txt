Congenital colour blindness

Acquired colour blindness

Congenital colour blindness :

Congential colour blindness occurs often in males.

It generally affects both eyes.

It is often hereditary in nature.

The primary disturbance is loss of perception of one or two fundamental colour.
The colour perception is formed in the retina cones.

There are three types of cones which can concept the colour red, blue,
purple respectively.

These cones cause chemical reactions & also cause nerve impulses which
are transmitted through the optic nerve to the brain.

The brain deciphers the colours.

Any disturbance on the pathway given above, may cause colour blindness.
Till, now effective drug for treating colour blindness has not been discovered.
