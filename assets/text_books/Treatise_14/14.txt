The eye lashes (31a at oer & fat X TP a ae) are short hair that grow from
the edge of the eyelid.

The upper eyelashes turn upward (SaX ot 3k AeA)

The lower eyelashes turn downward (td at 3x GgaT)

The upper lashes are longer than the lower lashes.

Eyelashes act as a barrier by sweeping foreign particles away from the eye.

Thus eyelashes protect the eye.

The upper & lower eyelids (SUX Ud =a at Tere) are thin folds of skin that can cover the
eye.

They reflexively close quickly to protect the eye from foreign objects, wind, dust, and
very bright light. This is called blinking of the eye. (31t a Seal sical Gleral Ua we eT)
Thus eyelids and blinking protect the eye.

The conjunctiva (37 six vere a eeifire fecit) protects the eyelids (qe1s).

When blinked, the eyelids help spread tears over the surface of the eye.

Tears consist of a salty fluid which continuously bathes the surface of the eye to keep
it moist (7).

Tears keep the surface of the eye moist.

Without moisture the cornea can become dried (a1), injured (uraci), infected (apfta)
& opaque (37Resfa).

Tears trap & sweep away small particles that enter the eye.

Tears are rich in antibodies (sfaftvs) that help prevent infection (aT).

The eyelids & tears protect the eye while allowing clear access to light.

The lacrimal glands (arqaPerai) are located at the top outer edge of each eye.
