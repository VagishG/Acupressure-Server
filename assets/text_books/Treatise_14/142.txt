Acuity (gfe dteoren) is measured on a scale.

It compares a person's vision at 6 meters with that of someone who has perfect vision.
Thus a person who has 6/6 vision sees objects that are 6 meters away with the same
clarity as a person with normal vision.

But a person who has 6/18 vision sees at 6 meters what a person with perfect vision
sees at 18 meters.

An eye chart called snellen chart is used to assess sharpness of vision.

It is a large card or lighted box which displays rows of letters in progressively smaller
& smaller sizes.

The card is read from a standard distance. Visual acuity is determined by the size of
the rows of letters that a person can read.

Normal vision is described as 6/6.

It requires that all the letters in a line at the bottom of the chart be read correctly.

If one can read only the letters twice as large as those on the 6/6 line, the visual acuity
is said to be 6/12.
