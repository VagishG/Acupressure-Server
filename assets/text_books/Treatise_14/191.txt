“Know Your
Eyes
Half of the fibres of the optic nerve cross over to the other side at the optic chiasm.

Impulses from each side of the eyesvisual field are sent to the other side of the brain.

Because of this structure, damage to the optic chiasm can lead to specific patterns of
vision loss.

The eye ball is divided into two sections.
Each section is filled with fluid.

This chamber extends from the cornea (dace) to the lens (sia aT veal).
The acqueous humor (@M Orit Ski aXci) is produced in the back chamber.
It flows slowly through the pupil into the front chamber.
It drains out of the eyeball through edge of the iris.

This aqucous humour (watery fluid) maintains shape of the eye.

The pressure inside the eye is determined by how much acqueous humour is
produced & how much is reabsorbed into the body through the tiny drainage channel.

Abnormally high fluid pressure occurs in glaucoma.
