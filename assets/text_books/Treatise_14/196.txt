Dr. Voll has suggested that also treat urinary Bladder for problems in tear gland.
The tear gland is an almond shaped gland (aa & 316K a Fe) inside the
upper & outer parts of the orbit, which secretes a watery fluid, the tears. The
normal function of the tears is to keep the exposed surface moist. Irritation or
emotion increases secretion. Tear gland gets its sympathetic nerve supply from
superior cervical Ganglion and parasympathetic nerve supply from the facial.
The movement of eyelid helps to spread the tears over the conjunctiva surface.
The tears ultimately collects into a triangular area in the inner angle of the eye.
From here it goes to points above the lateral crest of the orbit (31@ at orbit oT
aiett ferax) & below zygomatics (mer St get & AAA st AeraT) frontal suture.
