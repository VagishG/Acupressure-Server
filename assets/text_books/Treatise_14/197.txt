The retina is the innermost layer of the wall of the eye. It is an extremely delicate
structure and is especially adapted to be stimulated by light rays. It is composed
of several layers of nerve cell bodies and their fibres, lying on a pigmented layer
of epithelial cells which attach it to the choroid. The layer highly sensitive to light
is the layer of rods and cones.

The retina is the photosensitive part of the eye. The light sensitive nerve cells
are :

Cones are specialised cells of the retina of the eye which are able to distinguish
colour.
a) Rods : The rods are more sensitive than the cones. They are stimulated

Retinal detachment %é1 sem erm :

This is the painless condition. It occurs when a tear or hole in the retina allows
fluid to accumulate between the layers of the retinal cells or between the retina
and choroid. It is localised at first but as fluid collects the detachment spreads.
