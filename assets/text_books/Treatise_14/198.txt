and odonton 8 (wisdom tooth) lower also. If there is a problem in odonton 8
(wisdom tooth) lower treat EYE 5 & 6 and vice versa.

Choroid is a thin pigmented layer which separates the posterior part of the sclera
from the retina. It is very rich in blood vessels and is a deep chocolate brown in
colour. The choroid remains just behind the retina forming 5/6th of the middle
coat of eye.
