Special Note :
Dr. Voll has suggested that in the problems of viterous body also treat the large
intestine & odonton No. 6 (Lower)

Viterous body is a colourless Jelly like transparent mass which fills the posterior
segment (posterior 4/5th) of the eye ball.
Function : vist Skit a2 (Viterous humor) a Her ort Aa a thong sad TET Zl

The viterous body maintains shape and sufficient intraocular pressure of the eyeball
to support the retina against the choroid and prevent the walls of eye ball from
collapsing. The viterous body acts as a refractive medium.

Opacity of viterous body may be due to :

i) Choroditis : Treat Eye-6, Heart & Pericardium also.

ii) _ Haemorrhage in retina or detachment of retina due to injury :
Treat Eye-5, Small Intestine, Endocrines also.

Retinal detachment is the cause of localised liquefaction (AXci@%1) of the viterous
body and as a result a part of the retina floats in viterous cavity.
