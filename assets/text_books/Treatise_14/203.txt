Special Note :

Dr. Voll has suggested that in the problems of Iris also treat biliary system, Gall
Bladder & odonton 3 lower. Also treat OR 3 MP for oculomotor Nerve (CN III) which
supplies the intrinsic muscles of Iris.

The iris is the visible coloured part of the eye & extends anteriorly from the ciliary
body, lying behind the cornea infront of the lens.

The colour of the iris is generally determined & depends on the number of pigment
cells present. Albinos have no pigment cells (aba Wael & tare Her ae aa 2)
and people with blue eye have fewer than those with brown eyes.

In the centre of the iris, there is an aperture (]w), the pupil.

Function :

The pupil varies in size depending upon the intensity of light. In bright light the circular
muscles fibre of the iris contract & constrict the pupil. In dim light the radiating muscle
fibres contract dilating the pupil.
