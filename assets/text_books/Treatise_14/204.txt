Special Note :

Dr. Voll has suggested that in the problem of the cornea, also treat liver, palatine
tonsil, odonton 3 lower. Dr. Voll has further suggested that temporal headache may
cause problems in the cornea & vice versa. At times a treatment of the temporal
headache simultaneously treats the corneal problems. Corneal opacity may be due
to hyper calcination caused by hyper parathyroid.

The cornea is transparent. It replaces the sclera over the anterior one sixth of the
eyeball. The cornea is convex (JA@tax) anteriorly & is involved in refracting or binding
light rays to focus them on the retina. The normal size of cornea is 11 mm (vertical)
x 12mm (lateral) x 0.5-1 mm thick.

Function :
1) Cornea allows free entry of light.
2) Corea acts as a refractive medium.
Cornea gets its nutrition from lymph & aqueous humor. Hence treat Ly 2a R.P.
for Lymph Drainage of eye, to treat cornea.
Intraocular Pressure :

The pressure of humor should be 25 to 30 mm of Hg. The pressure of eye ball can
be felt by palpating the eyeball with two fingers. The pressure is measured with the
help of tonometer. The intraocular pressure becomes high in glaucoma.
