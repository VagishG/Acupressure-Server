Functions of lens :

To refract light and focus it exactly on retina.

Oxygen (Og) lack & Carbon dioxide (CO9) excess and other pathological conditions
cause degeneration of the lens. In the young, the lens is rich in cystine necessary
for local tissue oxidation. As the age advances, the cystine content falls. The nutrition
of lens is maintained by the aqueous humour over the lens. Due to malnutrition or
dietary deficiencies, the lens become opaque. This condition is known as Cataract.
