The fibers originate in the retina of the eyes & they combine to form the optic nerve.
Optic Nerves are directed backwards. Impulses pass from optic nerves to the centre
of sight in the occipital lobes of cerebrum and to the cerebellum. In the occipital lobe
sight is perceived. In the cerebellum the impulses from the eyes contribute to the
maintenance of balance, posture & orientation of the head in space.
