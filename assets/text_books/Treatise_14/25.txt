The lacrimal glands (31gufrat) produce the watery portion of the tears.
Mucous glands (x¢ifér@ aferai) in the conjunctiva produce mucous (cts).

This mucous mixes with the watery portion of the tears to create a more protective
tear film.

Tears drain out from each eye into the nose through one of the two nasolacrimal ducts

(after sraganfert).

Each of these ducts has opening at the edge of the upper & lower eyelid near the nose.
Thus tears protect the eye.

In some conditions, not enough tears are made.
