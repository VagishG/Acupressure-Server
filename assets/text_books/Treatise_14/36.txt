Cataract (aiftrenfarg)

A cataract is a clouding (tem) of the lens (31m@ oT val) of the eye that causes a
progressive, painless loss of vision.

The lens consists of water & protein. Eventually some of the protein may clump
together (s@gq 1) and start to cloud a small area of the lens. That is called an opacity.
(ataxeffer) Over a period of time the opacities increase in number & may become a
cataract. Cataract is a condition of any opacity of lens. (@fteveet & srareaffan)

Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide.

Cataract may be present in any year of age but more in senile. ({@Im1)
Cataract may be congenital or acquired.

Acquired cataract mostly occurs in senile age. (§¢It %)
