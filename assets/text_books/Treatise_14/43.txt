In PE the nucleus is not removed in one piece instead it is broken up & liquified
or emulsified (faa 4AM). This is done by the minute vibrations of a hand held
ultrasound probe.

Then it is sucked out through a niddle.

The advantage of this method is that only 3mm incision is made to insert the
probe.

PE has become a 'no-stitch' procedure. The surgeon makes the incision in the
sclera tunnels under it into the cornea and ends the incision in a corneal flap.
Pressure of fluid in the eye forces the flap to seal itself.

In this no-stitch surgery the healing process is faster and reduces the risk of
astigmatism. (gf aa721)

Astigmatism occurs because the stitches used in cataract surgery pull on the
cornea slightly, causing flattening along one curve.
