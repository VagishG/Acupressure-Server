Chalazions are swellings in the eyelid caused by blockage of one of the oil glands that
lubricate the eye.

A chalazion is usually painless.

It may be small or large enough to blur vision. Small chalazions clear up without
treatment.

Treatment :
i) Apply a warm water compress using a clean cloth twice a day for five minutes
each.

ii) If the chalazion becomes infected by bacteria living on the eyelid, it may
become painful & red.

iii) Doctors sometimes prescribe antibiotics and / or corticosteroid eyedrops to
treat the chalazion.

iv) In severe cases, surgery to drain the chalazion is performed on an outpatient
basis, using a local anaesthesia.
