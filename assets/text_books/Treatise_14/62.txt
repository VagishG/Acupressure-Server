Crossed eyes or strabismus (#a10")

It is defect in the coordination of the muscles that move the eyes.

It causes the eyes to be misaligned.

The two eyes point in different directions.

Normally the two eyes move in coordination so that they focus on an object together,
which is necessary for clear vision.

Strabismus (#7104) most often occurs in infants & children. In adults it usually

develops as a result of a disorder that affects the brain, the nerves which control eye

muscles or eye muscles themselves.

Symptoms qa:

i) The main symptom of strabismus in adults is double vision. One eye does not
move in coordination with the other eye.

ii) One eye may look straight while the other eye turns inward. This is called
esotropia.

ii) | One eye may look straight while the other eye turns outward. This is called
exotropia.

iv) One eye may look straight while the other eye turns downward or upward. This
is called vertical strabismus.

Sometimes the lack of coordination is intermittent.

Sometimes it is continuous.

Sometimes squinting is there in bright sun light.

In squinting, there may be faulty depth perception.

Treatment :

Children & infants with crossed eyes should be provided with earlier treatment.

The earlier the treatment is provided, the better is the chance for normal vision.

In children, the brain reacts to the double vision.

It begins to ignore signals from the weak eye. If this goes on for long, the brain loses
the ability to recognise signals from the weak eye, even if the strabismus is later
corrected with surgery.
