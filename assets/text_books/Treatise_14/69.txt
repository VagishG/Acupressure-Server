Dry Eyes (at aire)

Tears are produced by the lacrimal gland. (anh)

With every blink tears protect, lubricate and cleanse the surface of the eye.

A healthy tear film has three layers.

i) The upper layer is called superficial layer. This superficial layer is oily and is
produced by melbomian glands.

ii) The middle layer is watery & is produced by the lacrimal glands. (sapere)

iii) | The inner most layer is mucous layer. It helps the watery layer spread evenly
over the cornea.

What causes dry eyes ?
i) Sometimes the lacrimal glands do not produce enough tears.

ii) Sometimes the three layers that make up the normal tear film are out of
balance. It causes faster evaporation of tears.

ili) Dry eye occurs when the tear film that coats the eye break down & patches of
the cornea dry out.
