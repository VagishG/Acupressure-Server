Exophthalmos (Aa there 1 Aa Jer a sex Freer SIFT)

Exophthalmos is an abnormal bulging of one or both eyes. There may be a feeling of
pressure around the eyes.

The protruding eye is less protected by the eyelids. The person can not close eyes
completely. The cornea may become too dry. As a result of this, corneal ulcer may form.
Corneal ulcer may get infected afterwards.

increased pressure within the orbit may result in compression of the optic nerve. This can
also impair vision.
