Focussing Problems
(were feXOH GI retina WK de 8 a EAN)

Problems with focussing is the most common cause of blurred vision.
This kind of blurred vision comes on slowly.

It affects both eyes and the total field of vision.

The process of focussing is called refraction.

The eye is like a camera.

If the camera lens focuses light directly on the film, the picture is sharp.

If the camera lens focuses light little in front of or litle behind the flim, the picture is
blurred.

It is the same with the eye.

When the light rays enter a normal eye, the cornea and lens refract the rays so that
they are focused precisely on the retina.

Focal point is the point at which light rays come to perfect focus.

Focal point for close objects is different.

Focal point for distant objects is different.

Focus point for close objects is further back in the eyes than the distant objects.

The amount of refraction (31a) by cornea is constant.

The amount of refraction (31a4) by the lens can be controlled.

Tiny ligaments (argent) attach the lens to a ring of muscles. This ring of muscles is
called ciliary body.

The ciliary body can cause the lens to become more round by changing the tension in
the ligaments. (STqa-erit)

This makes the focal point fall closer to the lens.

The ciliary body can cause the lens to become flat. This makes the focal point fall
deeper in the eye. This process is called accomodation.
