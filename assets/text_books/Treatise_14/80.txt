Glaucoma (affRt a si & rex cara GI Sgal OT Srewafer)

Glaucoma is optic nerve damage due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) that
leads to progressive irreversible loss of vision.

Glaucoma occurs when there is an imbalance in production and drainage of fluid in the
eye. It increases eye pressure to unhealthy levels.

The aqueous fluid (waster) nourishes the eye.

It is produced by the ciliary body behind the iris.

It is the posterior chamber.

It flows to the front of the eye. It is the anterior chamber.

Here, it drains into drainage canals between the iris & cornea (the angle).

The system works like a faucet and sink.

Faucet is the ciliary body.

Sink is the drainage canals.

Balance between an open faucet and a properly draining sink-keeps the fluid flowing
freely.

Balance between ciliary body & drainage canals prevents pressure in the eye from
building up.

In glaucoma, the canals which the fluid drains become clogged, blocked or covered.
Fluid can not leave the eye even though new fluid is being produced in the back chamber.
The pressure in the eye increases.

When the pressure becomes higher than the optic nerve can tolerate, glaucoma
results.

Glaucoma is of two types aiftrr-u at nar oT ete Ã©:

1) Open angle glaucoma wgeretnr after

2) Closed angle glaucoma e-aator aftr

1) Open angle glaucoma genet aftr :

The drainage canals in the eyes become clogged gradually over months or
years. Pressure in the eye rises slowly because fluid is produced at a normal
rate but drains slowly. The angle where the iris meets the cornea is called the
drainage angle.
