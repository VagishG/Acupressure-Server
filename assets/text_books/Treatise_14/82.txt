Blindness due to open-angle glaucoma is about six times more common among
Indians.

Diagnosis of glaucoma 3ir@ ala wt Par:

i)

Pressure in the eye is measured.
This is done painlessly with an instrument gallet torome*ntiwinicicr.

ii)

il)

Eye pressure reading of greater than 20 to 22 mmhg of mercury are considered
higher than normal.

But one third of glaucoma patients have normal eye pressure.

So doctors also use an ophthalmoscope and a slit lamp to see changes in the
optic nerve that indicates damage from glaucoma.

Visual field testing helps detecting blind spots. It is done with a machine that
determines the person's ability to see small dots of light in all areas of the visual
field.

iv) The gonioscope allows the doctor to determine, if the glaucoma is of the open
angle or closed angle type.

Treatment :

i) The loss of vision due to glaucoma, can not be reversed.

ii) But if the glaucoma is detected, proper treatment can prevent further vision loss.

iii) Treatment of glaucoma is life long.

iv) It involves decreasing eye pressure by reducing the amount of fluid produced
by the eye or by increasing fluid drainage.

vy) Eye drops and surgery are the main treatment, for open angle and closed angle
glaucoma.

vi) Most people with open angle glaucoma respond well to these drugs.

vil) | With closed angle glaucoma surgery is the main treatment.

viii) | Glaucoma eye drops are safe but may cause side effects.

ix) Laser surgery can be used to open clogged drainage canals in people with
open-angle glaucoma. This is called laser trabeculoplasty.

x) Laser surgery can be done to make an opening in the iris in people with closed
angle glaucoma. This is called laser peripheral iridectomy or iridotomy.

xi) In both surgeries the patient can go home the same day.

xii) | Glaucoma filteration surgery is the other form of surgery to treat glaucoma.
