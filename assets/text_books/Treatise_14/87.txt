eye disorders
If only nearby objects are blurred the person is farsighted or hyperopic.
(aaftea)
In the middle age most people develop difficulty focusing on nearby
objects. It is called presbyopia. (SRIEXGRZ)
Astigmation (¢ff as) is another type of refractive error. It is caused by
an irregularity in the curvature of the cornea (aajuéci) or lens. (31k ST val)
It results in slight blurring of vision
Depth perception (7Texreit ter) is the ability to determine the relative
position of objects in space.
Person with impaired depth perception may have difficulty in distinguishing
which of the two objects is closer.
Depth perception is reduced in the following cases :
i) When one eye is blind.
ii) | When the eye has an uncorrected refractive error.

iii) It may also be impaired by a failure of the brain to integrate the two
images, one from each eye, into a single three diemensional
image. This is called fusion. It results in double vision.

Many depth perception clues come from only one eye. Hence if a
person closes one eye and looks at two objects, he can usually tell
which object is closer even with only one eye.

Double vision is seeing two images of one object. This is called diplopia.
(feafte)
Double vision may result from :

i) Weakness in one or more of the eye muscles which control eye
movements may result in cross eye. Cross eye is called
strabismus. (7174)

ii) Fatigue ar
iii) Alcohol intoxication 3RT@ GT Ast
