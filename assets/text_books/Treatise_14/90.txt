Near Sightedness (Myopia)
foe gftea

In nearsightedness, distant objects are blurred but near objects can be seen clearly.

This is also called myopia or short sightedness. (Fracqftean)

Normal vision @rara gf =

In normal vision, the light focuses directly on the retina, producing a sharp image.

In near sighteness, light rays from distant objects are focused in front of the retina due
to either an elongated eyeball or a lens or cornea that excessively bends the light rays.
Myopia (fYaeqftea) is common and runs in families. It usually starts from a child's
primary school period and progressively worsens until late 20s.

Glasses or contact lenses are generally prescribed to focus the distant light rays
properly on the retina, by making the focal point for distant objects fall further back in
the eye.

Glasses or contact lenses do not cure, reverse or slow the progression of near
sightedness.
