TCM syndrome differentiation treatment is an effective treatment.

In some cases acupressure treatment can produce satisfactory or even curative effect.

In TCM main emphasis is given on the following aspects while treating cancer :

i) â€” Strengthen the body resistance

ii) Restore normal functioning of the body.

ii) Consolidate the constitution

iv) Resolve phlegm

v) Eleminates stagnancy

Hence, first of all the vital Qi is replenished. Then resistance is strengthened. After

that the self cancerocidal mechanism is aroused & strengthened. Thus the cancerous

cells are flinched naturally & dye.

Only cancer medicine does not destroy the cancer cells, but patient's vital Qi also
reduced slowly and immune system also becomes deficient. At last cancer does not get
cured by body also becomes very weak day by day.

So Acupressure therapist must energize the vital Qi of the patient while treating the
cancer. This will increase immune system of the patient. Deficiency of life essence is the
main reason for the diseases. By balancing the life essence or vital Qi cancer like disease
also can be cured . Only one has to known and identified the problem in creativity in the
body and which organs are deficient in vital energy.
