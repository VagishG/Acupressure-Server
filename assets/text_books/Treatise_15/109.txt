1) Mouth:
Digestion starts processing from mouth. Saliva get activated as soon as the smell of
food touches. Sometime only the thought of the food starts lubricating the saliva in the
mouth. The saliva glands get active before the food is in the mouth, so we can say that
digestion get started before we eat. When food touches the mouth and get inside teeth
makes then into small pieces. Enzyme amylase of the saliva helps the food into chemical
breakdown. Amylase is the chemical enzyme who changes starch into sugar.
