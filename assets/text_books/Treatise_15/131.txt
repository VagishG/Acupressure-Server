Salivary Glands

Saliva is the first digestive juice in Digestive System. There are three pair of glands are
there in mouth for the secretion of Saliva. They are :

@ 2Parotid Glands

@ = =2Submandibular Glands

© = 2Sublingual Glands

All the three pairs of Saliva Glands secreate around one to one and half litre
of saliva daily. Secreation of saliva is a continuous process but it get increases when we
take food.

Parotid Glands :

Parotid Glands are just below the external acoustic meatus on the sides of the
face. It is connected to Parotid duct at the level of upper molar tooth. It secreats

20% of Saliva.

Submandibular Glands :
At the angle of jaw both sides of the face each submandibular glands are there called
lower jaws glands. The ducts of lower jaw are two which opens in the base of mouth.
They are at trenulum of the tongue on the both side. They secreats 75% of saliva.

Sublingual Gland :

In front of lower jaw's gland under the tongue are named at sublingual glands.
They consists small ducts which works from the mucous membrane of the base of

mouth. They creates 5% saliva only.
Nerve Supply of Salivary Gland :

Parasympathetic and Sympathetic nerve supply helps salivary glands to work.
Parasympathetic nerve supply increases the flow of saliva and sympathetic nerve
supply decreases the flow of saliva.

Flow of saliva is controlled by autonomic nervous system. Paraympathetic stimulation
vasodiation controls the water level and increases or sometime balances the water
level and in that enzyme and other organic substances relatively less.
