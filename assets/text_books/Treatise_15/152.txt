Anorectal Fistula

An anorectal fistula is an abnormal channel from the anus or rectum to the skin near
the anus.
Occassionally the fistula is from anus or rectum to the vagina or any other organ.

A fistula usually develops when a rectal abscess spreads in canal-like fashion from
the inside of the rectum to the outer skin.
