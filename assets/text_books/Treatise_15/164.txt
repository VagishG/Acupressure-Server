Oesophagus

Our food reaches to stomach through Oesophagus. Diameter of oesophagus 2 cm
and length is 25 cm. The place when oesophagus connects to Stomach it takes turns
against from down to upper side. This turn prevents food to return in the mouth. It prevents
regurgitation (backward flow) of gastric contents in the Oesophagus.

Oesophagus has two parts :

1. Upper Oesophagus

2. Lower Oesophagus
1. UPPER OESOPHAGUS:

Upper part of Oesophagus connects pharynx, food enter to oesophagus from this

joint only. At this junction a muscular sphincter is there which is called as

cricopharyngeal sphincter. This sphincter prevents air enter into food pipe while
breathing.
2. LOWER OESOPHAGUS:

This is the lower and the last part of Oesophagus. This is connected to STomach.
Sphincter muscle on this place named as lower oesophageal sphincter. This sphincter
prevents food going back to oesophagus from stomach (Prevention for backflow). Contraction
and relaxation is the process which food follows from oesophagus to Stomach.
