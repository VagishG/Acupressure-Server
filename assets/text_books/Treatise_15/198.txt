cm cut on abdomen has been done for removing the Gall Bladder.

Nowa days 95% removal is done by laproscopical method. In this method they
make four holes in abdomen and remove the Gall Bladder through tube. This
method is called laproscopic cholecystectomy. This operation is less painful for

instrument cuts Gall Bladder into pieces and takes out. These small holes get
healed faster.

Bladder. Bile acids can dissolve some gall stones. Small stones get dissolve in
six months by medicine but bigger stones takes time of one or two years for
dissolveing. Only 50% patient are benefited. After 5 years 50% patient get stones
again in Gall Bladder.

necessary to operate and remove it.

small pieces to pass through bile ducts & be eliminated. The stones recur within
five years of lithotripsy in 50% of the cases. Lithotripsy is rarely advised, since itis
