Then the antrum (lower stomach) contracts rhythmically, mixing the food with acids

and enzymes.

These acids and enzymes are called stomach juices.

Here food get crushed into tiny molecules so it can be digested easily.

These three juices are created by the stomach:

i) | Mucous

li) Hydrochloric acid

iil) Pepsin (Itis an enzyme that breaks down proteins)

Mucous protects the inner living of stomach from acid and enzymes. Mucous gets

infected and destroyed by the bacteria named “Helicobacterpylori”. Aspirin also harms

the inner wall of stomach (which used normally as ‘blood thinner’). Due to aspirin

Stomach ulcer appears.

Hydrochloric acid provides the highly acidic environment needed for pepsin to break

down proteins. The stomach acid also serves as a barrier against infection by killing

bacteria. Acid secretion is stimulated by nerve impulses to the stomach.

Small intestine :

i) Food enters the duodenum through pylorus in amounts that the small intestine
can digest. Duodenum is the first part of small intestine.

ii) When full, the duodenum signals the stomach to stop sending further food.

iii) The duodenum receives pancreatic enzymes from the pancreas and bile from
liver and gall bladder.

iv) Peristalis aids digestion and absorption by churning up food and mixing it with
intestinal secretions.

v) The duodenal lining has folds and small projections called villi and smaller
projection called microvilli.

vi) These villi and microvilli helps in greater absorption of nutrients.

vii) Other parts of the small intestine are jejunum and ileum. These parts are largely
responsible for the absorption of fats and other nutrients.

viii) The intestinal wall is richly supplied with blood vessels that carry the absorbed
nutrients to the liver through the portal vein.
