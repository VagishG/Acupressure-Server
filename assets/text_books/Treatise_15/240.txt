In duodenum food is diluted with pancreatic enzymes and bile, which decreases
stomach acidity.

The intestinal wall releases mucous. It lubricates the intestinal contents and water.
Small amounts of enzymes that digest proteins, sugar and fats are also released.

Pancreas:

The pancreas consists of two parts :

The acini, which produce digestive enzymes.
The islet, which produce hormones.

The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into duodenum and hormones into
the blood stream.

The cells of the acini releases the following enzymes :

a) Amylase
b) Lipase
c) Trypsin

These enzymes flow via pancreatic duct to the common bile duct, from where

both flow into duodenum.

Amylase digests carbohydrates.

Lipase digests fats.

Trypsin digests proteins.

The pancreas also secretes large amount of sodium bicarbonate, which protects

the duodenum by neutralising the acid that comes from the stomach.

Following three hormones are produced by the pancreas :

a) Insulin, which lowers the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by moving
sugar into cells.

b) Glucagon, which raises the level of sugar in the blood by stimulating the
liver to release its store.

c) Somatostatin, which prevents the above referred two hormones from
being released.
