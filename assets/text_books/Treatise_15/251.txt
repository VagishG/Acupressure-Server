Liver :
The liver is a large organ with several functions.

The nutrients of food are absorbed into the intestinal wall. The intestinal wall is
supplied with many tiny blood vessels. These blood vessels carry the absorbed
nutrients to the portal vein.

The portal vein takes these nutrients to the liver.

The incoming blood is processed in the liver. The blood in the liver is processes in two
ways :

i) Bacteria & viruses are removed.

i) | Many nutrients are further broken down so that these can be used by the body.
The liver does the processing at high speed. Then, the liver supplies the blood,
laden with nutrients, into the general circulation.

The liver produces about half of the body's cholestrol. The rest comes from food.
80% of the cholestrol produced by liver is used to make bile.

The liver secretes bile, which is stored in the gall bladder.

Gall Bladder :

i) Bile flows out of the liver through the right and left hepatic ducts.

ii) Right and left hepatic ducts come together to form the common hepatic duct.

iii) The common hepatic duct then joins with a duct coming from the gall bladder,
called the cystic duct, to form the common bile duct.

iv) The pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct, just where it empties into the
duodenum.

v) Between meals, the bile salts are stored in the gall bladder.

vi) Food that enters the duodenum triggers a series of hormonal and nerve signals
that cause the gall bladder to contract. As a result of this, the bile flows into the
duodenum and mixes with the food.

vil) Bile has two important functions :
a) _ Itassists in the digestion and absorption of fats.

b) It eliminates certain waste products from the body. Hemoglobin from the
destroyed red blood cells and excess cholestrol are eliminated.
