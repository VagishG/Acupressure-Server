Bile salts increase the solubility of cholestrol, fats & fat soluble vitamins to aid in
their absorption.

Bile salts stimulate the secretion of water by the large intestine to help move the
stool.

Bilirubin is excreted in bile as a waste product of destroyed red blood cells. It
gives stool a green brown colour.

Drugs and other waste products are excreted in bile and later elimanated from
the bile.

Bile salts are reabsorbed by the last portion of the small intestine.

The large intestine consists of :

i) Thececum
ii) |The ascending colon (right side)
ili) The transverse colon

iv) The sigmoid colon

v) Therectum

The cecum : Itis at the begining of the ascending colon. It is the point at which the
â€˜small intestine joins the large intestine.

Projecting from the cecum is the appendix. The appendix is a small finger shaped
tube that serves no known function. According to TCM the appendix provides
immunity from allergies & infections.

The large intestine secretes mucous. It is responsible for the absorption of water
from the stool.

The intestinal contents are liquid when they reach the large intestine. They are
solid by the time they reach the rectum as stool.

Many bacteria inhibit the large intestine. Bacteria in the large intestine makes
vitamin k, which plays an important role in blood clotting.

These bacterias are necessary for healthy intestinal function. Hence, these are
called beneficial bacteria.
