QQ LawNo.1
Pancreas controls the following four types of metabolisms :
1) Protein digestion and metabolisms
2) Uric acid metabolism and synthesis
3) Carbohydrate metabolism & digestion
4) Fatorlipid digestion and metabolism
Q > LawNo.2
Protein digestion and metabolism is controlled by Pn 1.
i) Proteins supply amino acids.

ii) Aminoacids build, repair and maintain body tissue and are vital to everyday body
functions.

ili) The body needs a constant supply of protein to repair body cells, which wear out
and to help regulate body processes.

iv) Proteins are needed for growth, synthesis of enzymes, plasma proteins, antibodies
(ammunoglobulins) and some hormones.

v) Excess protein is excreted by kidneys as detatched nitrogenous part.

vi) First class protein is found in meat, fish, soya beans, milk, eggs, milk products
(excluding butter).

vil) Incomplete second class protein is found in cereals & pulses, bread & potatos.
These do not contain all the essential amino acids in correct proportions.

Protein is needed to fight viral infections.
Pancreas produces proteolytic enzymes.
ix) Protein metabolism includes :

vill

a) Trypsin : This proteolytic enzyme found in the pancreatic juice.
b) Chymotrypsin : This enzyme is found in Pancreas to formation of protein.

These both enzymes forms in the duodenum, the part of small intestine.
They creats amino acids deficiency of this digests in the pancreas.
