globulins is very much needed for immune response to an antigen. If formation of
globulins is less. then treatment :

Treatment: Pn 1,Liv3, Ci7b, Ly 11 Tall points

This is a soluble protein in the blood, which formates unsoluble fibrin protein
which helps stop blood flow by making clots in the blood. Which is formed in
