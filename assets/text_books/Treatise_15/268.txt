v) Whenuric acid increases in the blood then monocrystals of uric acid named as
sodium urate monohydrate forms 2/3 of monocrystals is created by Kidney and
1/3 of monocrystals of uric acid excreated by G. |. T. When the formation in excess
and Kidney is not capable of excreting they get collected in the joints and creates

inflammation.

Treatment of uric acid metabolims :

Pn2 : This point control, the entire uric acid metabolism. If uric acid is in
excess then this piont should be T (tone). When persons have
deficiency of uricase enzyme. Then uric acid becomes more in
blood.

Ci8eT(R) :  CardiacGanglion.

AD1L : Allergies of lower half of body metabolism forms more uric acid.

PniaT : CMP pancreas endocrine function

Ci8eT(L) : Thoracic aortic plexus.

Liv2&2al : â€” Itreduces the catabolism of nuclic acid .

K3t :  MPrenal parenchyma

K1-3T : CMP forkidney & ureter.

This reduces the formation of uric acid.
Kid : Excretion of uric acid get increased from Kidney by this.
