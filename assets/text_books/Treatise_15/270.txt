Enzyme abnormalities result in the body being unable to convert fats into energy.

These abnormalities are called fatty acid oxidation disorders.

i) Fats are composed of fatty acids & glycerol.

ii) Each gram of fat supplies the body with about 9 calories, more than twice
that supplied by proteins or carbohydrates.

iii) The body stores any excess energy as fat.

vi) The body deposits excess fat in the abdomen (omental fat) and under the
skin (subcutaneous fat) to use when it needs more energy.

v) The body also stores fat in blood vessels and within organs, where it blocks
the blood flow.
vi) There are three types of fats :
a) Saturated fats
b) Monosaturated fats
c) Polysaturated fats
vii) Saturated fats are more likely to increase cholestrol levels and increase the
risk of atheroscerosis.
The food taken contains fats.
The pancreas produces esterases & lipases enzymes. These enzymes
dissimilate the fat.
These enzymes dissimilate the fat.
Bile produces steapsin enzyme. Steapsin enzyme activates lipase.
Digested fats are absorbed as fatty acids & glycerol into lacteals.
Then they are transported to liver via cystema chyli & thoracic duct to blood stream.

Fatty acid & glycerol circulating in the blood are used by cells of organs & glands
to provide energy & synthesis of their secretions.

Inlivera part of fatty acid & glycerol are used to provide energy & heat.
Remaining part of fatty acid & glycerol are used for triglycerides in liver.

Triglycerides consists of three fatty acids, chemically combined with a glycerol
molecule.
