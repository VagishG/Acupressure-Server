Antibiotics can upset the balance among the different types of bacteria in the
large intestine. This results in irritation which leads to the secretion of mucous
and water causing diarrhoea.

Rectum and Anus:

1)

2)

The rectum is a chamber. It begins at the end of the large intestine, immidiately
following the sigmoid colon. It ends, at the anus.

Stool is stored in the descending colon so the rectum is empty.

When the descending colon becomes full, the stool passes in the rectum, causing
an urge to move the bowels.

Adults and older children can withstand this urge until they reach a toilet.

{Infants and young children lack the muscle control necessary to delay the bowel
movement.

The anus is the opening at the far end of the digestive tract through which the
stool leaves the body.

The anal sphincter is a muscular ring, which keeps the anus closed until the
person has a bowel movement.
