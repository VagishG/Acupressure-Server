3) Sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate are the strongest antacids. Continuous
use of these drugs may make the blood too alkaline, resulting in nausea, headache
and weakness.

4) Therefore these antacids should not be used in large quantities for more than a
few days.

5) Aluminium hydroxide is a relatively safe and commonly used antacid. But
aluminium may bind with phosphate in the digestive tract, reducing phosphate
levels in the blood causing weakness and loss of appetite. It may also cause
constipation.

6) Magnesium hydroxide is a more effective antacid than aluminium hydroxide. It
may cause diarrhoea.

7) Acid reducing drugs Histamine-2 blockers such as cimetidine, famotidine,
nizatidine, ranitidine, relieve symptoms and promote ulcer healing by reducing
the production of stomach acid.

8) Proton pump inhibitors promote healing of ulcers in a short period of time. They
treat the condition that causes excess secretion of stomach acid.

9)  Sucralfate may work by forming a protective coat in the base of an ulcer to promote
healing. It works well on peptic ulcers. It causes constipation.

10) Misoprostol may be used to reduce the likelihood of developing stomach & duodenal
ulcers caused by NSAIDS.

11) Surgery for ulcers is now seldom necessary because the drugs are very effective
in healing peptic ulcers.
