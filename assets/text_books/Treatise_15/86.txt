Cholera

Cholera is an acute infection of the small intestine.

Itis caused by the bacterium vibrio cholerae. This bacteria releases a toxin that causes
severe watery diarrhoea.

Cholera always causes severe dehyration and can be life threatening.

Itis spread by ingesting water or food that is contaminated with the bacterium vibrio
cholerae produces a toxin that causes the small intestine to secrete enormous amount of
fluid, in the form of watery diarrhoea that is rich in salts & minerals.

Itis the loss of fluid and minerals that causes death.

The bacteria remain within the small intestines and do not invade tissues. Because
the bacteria are sensitive to stomach acid people with lower amounts of acid (such as
young children & older people) are more susceptible to the disease.

Symptoms & diagnosis :

Symptoms come after getting the infection between one to three days :

The disease starts with sudden painless watery diarrhoea and vomiting.

In Cholera loose motion with barborygmus occurs; but there is no pain. No blood in the

loose motion. Bacteria's of cholera are found in loose motion. Usually first loose motion

starts and then vomiting. Undigested food or infectional food's symptoms are seen.

The amount of fluid lost through diarrhoea & vomiting is proportional to the severity of

the infection.

In severe condition infections, the diarrhea causes a loss of more than | quart per hour.

Within hours, the resulting depletion of fluid and salts leads to severe dehydration.

It causes intense thirst, muscle cramps, weakness & minimal urine production.

Severe loss of fluids from tissues causes the eyes to become sunken and the skin on

the fingers become severely wrinkled.

If the dehydration is not treated, the loss of fluid and salt can lead to kidney failure

shock, coma & death.

Symptoms usually subside in 3 to 6 days. Most people are free of bacteria in 2 weeks.
