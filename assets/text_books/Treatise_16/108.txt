When a person works extremely hard for long hours for months or years,
more Qi is consumed. Less Qi is restored for want of adequate rest.

In this case the person has to draw on to essence to cope up with the
exceeding requirement of Qi.

Inthe case mentioned in x) above, the essence will begin to deplete and
symptoms of deficiency of yin may appear.

When this point is reached, even adequate rest will not help the situation
very quickly but only over a long period of time.
