Acupressure is a relatively safe therapy.

Even if a wrong treatment is applied, in most cases, the energy rebalances
itself in a few days.

If there is an attack of any pathogenic factor such as attack of wind, cold
or wind heat etc, a treatment to expel the pathogenic factor by sedating
the relevant points should be given.

If one gives a tonifying treatment during an acute external attack, this
actually brings the external pathogenic factor inside the body and leads to
an aggravation. This is more aggrassive if moxa is used.
