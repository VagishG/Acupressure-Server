Spleen’s functional Qi goes upto lungs and heart in sending food essence to
these organs, where these are transformed into Qi and blood.

If the spleens functional Qi does not ascend properly, the food essence will not
be transported upwards and diarrhoea will be caused. In the long run there will
be deficiency of Qi and blood.

Spleen Qi descending is called contravection of spleen Qi or rebelious Qi. In
fact spleen Qi sinking pattern is called the contravection of the spleen Qi.

There is abnormal deficiency of spleen Qi and this causes the spleen Qi sinking
conditions.

Ascending of spleen Qi lifts and keeps the body organs in place.
If the spleen Qi sinks, prolapses may occur.

Following persons who have to stand long hours every day due to the nature of
their work, are likely to be affected by this pattern.
