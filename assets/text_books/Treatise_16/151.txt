3) When first to tonify upright Qi and then to expel pathogenic factors :

This is applied when :

a)
b)
c)
d)

e)

9)

h)

There is a pathogenic factor to be expelled.

But the upright Qi is very weak to use a reducing method. This will weaken
further if only reducing method is used.

This situation is rare.

This situation applies only to external patterns.

In this case first tonify the upright Qi and then expel the pathogenic factor.
Please note that only toning the upright Qi is not sufficient to expel the
pathogenic factors.

In the internal conditions, tonification of body's Qi and expelling the pathogenic
factor can be done at the same time.

This approach is seldom necessary and not generally used.

4) When first to expel the pathogenic factor, there after tone the upright Qi :
