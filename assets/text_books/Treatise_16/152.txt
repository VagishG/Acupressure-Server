iii) First expel the pathogenic factor by sedation. By this treatment excess type
of symptoms will go away.

iv) After this tonify upright Qi.

v) _ This is applicable to both internal & external conditions.

vi) No pathogenic factor should be left over, when we tone the upright Qi.
Example :

There is a patient suffering from deficiency of Qi. He is attacked by external wind heat
with symptoms of fever, headache, aversion to cold, bodyache, thirst etc.

In this case first treat the attack of wind heat by sedation method. When the fever is
over, then only tone the upright Qi.

In case you tone the upright Qi first, the wind heat symptoms will aggravate.

In this case if the pathogenic factor viz. external wind heat is not expelled fully, then the
patient will have recurrent sore throat (red throat), great tiredness & feeling of heat.

This is due to left over pathogenic factor.
It is important to clear the remaining heat before tonifying the upright Qi.
Another example :

A patient has chronic kidney and heart yang deficiency. He all of a sudden develops
acute retention of urine leading to edema & high blood pressure.

In this first of all treat the acute retention of urine by sedating Sp 9, St 28, CV 9, UB 53,
UB 22. In this case there is excess energy in the lower warmer.

After the urine passes properly & the edema goes, you can tonify kidney & heart yang.
Another example :
Apatient has a chronic liver blood deficiency.

All of a sudden, he develops liver wind causing a temporary spasm of cerebral vessel
and a small stroke with following symptoms.

. Paralysis of mouth & slurred speech.

e Giddiness

. Numbness

In this case first of all eliminate the pathogenic factors by sedating Liv 2, 3.

Only when the liver wind is eliminated and its symptoms are over, we can tonify liver
blood.
