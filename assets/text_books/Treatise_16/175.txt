If there is a problem in any internal organ treat distal points.

Treat Liv 3 to treat liver diseases.
Treat St 36 to treat stomach diseases.
Treat Sp 3 to treat spleen diseases.
Treat Lu 9 to treat lungs diseases.
Treat K 3 to treat kidneys diseases.
Treat H 7 to treat heart diseases.

If there is a chronic problem in any internal organ, treat distal points in combination
with the local points. The local points used are mainly back shu points and front
shu points for the affected organ concerned.
