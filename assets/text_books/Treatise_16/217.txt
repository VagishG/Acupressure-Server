The normal direction of the liver Qi is upwards. If the liver Qi stagnates, it may
attack stomach and jeopardis the stomach's function of descending the Qi and
food.

This results in ascending of stomach Qi. It causes nausea, belching and vomiting.

This contravection of the stomach Qi is caused by liver Qi stagnation. Here the
liver Qi is excess. The stomach Qi is deficient. The liver Qi attacks the stomach
and disturbs it in its normal functions of rotting and ripening the food and sends
it down to small intestine.

In this case the tongue will be red on sides, indicating liver Qi stagnation.
Cause of disease :

i) Irregular diet and overwork deptetes stomach.

ii) | Anger, resentment, frustration causes liver Qi stagnation.

iii) Alcohol, fried foods and meat contributes to heat in liver.
