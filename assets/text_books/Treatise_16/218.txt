Law No. 19
Contravection of the liver Qi going horizontally to the spleen causes alternation of
constipation and diarrhoea.
Pathology :
1) Direction of liver Qi should be upwards and
2) When the liver Qi stagnates, it attacks spleen, particularly when the spleen Qi
is deficient.
3) i) | When the stagnated liver Qi is predominent, there is constipation with
dry stools, difficult and bitty stools.

ii) | When the deficiency of the spleen Qi predominates, there are loose stools
and abdominal pain is slight. Here the deficient spleen allows itself to be
invaded by liver.

iii) Distension (3tRT) and pain in the abdomen is caused by the stagnation
of the liver Qi in the abdomen. Distension is the most characteristic
symptom of stagnation of Qi. There may also be some pain but the pain
is no severe.

interferes with the spleen function.
