Law No. 20

Contravection of the liver Qi going horizontally to the intestines causes dry stools,

lower abdomen twisting pain and borborygmus.

Pathology:

1) The normal direction of small intestine Qi is downwards. If the intestinal Qi
stagnates the food and fluids also stagnate in the intestines and can not flow
downwards. It causes twisting pain with distension in the lower abdomen.

2) Small intestine Qi stagnation is usually associated with stagnation of liver Qi

attacking spleen. Hence, three organs viz. intestines, liver and spleen are
involved.
