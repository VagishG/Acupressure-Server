2) When the liver Qi stagnates, it goes down and attacks the lower warmer,
particularly the urinary bladder, when the urinary bladder is cold & deficient and
is already attacked by external humid cold.

3) The invader liver Qi changes the humid cold to humid heat and causes burning
in urination and urinary tract infection.

4) Humidity obstructs the smooth flow of the fluids in the lower warmer causing
difficult urination, urgent urination, turbid urine and a sticky tongue coat. In extreme
case the humidity can turn into urinary sand and stones.

5) Heat in urinary bladder causes burning in urination, a dark urine, red tongue
with yellow coat and red spots with fast pulse.

Treatment : Liv 3, 13, 14, GB 34, Sp 6, 9, UB 22, 28, 63, 66, CV 3 yall
Liv 3, 13, 14,
& GB 34 : A treatment on these four points relieves stagnation of liver Qi.

Sp6&Sp9 : Atreatmenton these two points expels dampness from lower warmer.

UB 22 : It opens the water passages in the lower warmer.
