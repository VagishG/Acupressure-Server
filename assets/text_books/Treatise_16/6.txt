There is deficiency of blood in liver.

It creates emptiness in the blood vessels.

The blood vessels are then filled with the internal wind.

This is deficiency type of internal wind.

Shaking of head, tic and tremors are all due to internal wind.

Numbness is due to deficiency of blood not nourishing the muscles.

The tremors are very fine and not like convulsions.
