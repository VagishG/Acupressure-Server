Priorities during emergency first aid :

1) First of all assess the person's airway, breathing and circulation. This is called
ABC assessment.

A problem in the airway, breathing or circulation may be fatal if not corrected.
A) _ The airway through which air travels to the lungs can become blocked.
B) The breathing can cease in various illnesses and injuries.
C) The circulation of blood through the body can stop in cardiac arrest and
cessation of heart beat.

2) In cases of choking and some instances of cardiac arrest, the emergency first
aid treatment must be started before calling for medical help. 31 depict Veit wT

4) If many people are injured, the most seriously injured person should be treated
first. Determining who is in most urgent need of treatment may be difficult.
Someone screaming in pain may be less seriously injured than someone who
can not breathe or whose heart has stopped and therefore is quiet.

5) Assessment should take less than one minute per injured person.

6) In each case, the rescuer should consider whether the situation is life threaten-
ing, urgent but not life threatening or not urgent.
