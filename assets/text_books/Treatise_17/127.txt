Disease mechanism wm Ha fate:
Kidney controls reproduction. It regulates urethra, spermatic duct and anus.
Deficiency of kidney yang reduces the reproductive activity and causes impotency.

Due to deficiency of kidney yang the body can not be warmed. It results in cold ex-
tremities, pallor, dizziness & listlessness.

Lumbar region is the house of kidneys. Deficiency of kidney causes soreness & weak-
ness of lumbar & knees.

When the kidney yang fails to control urination, there is frequent urination.
Pale tongue with white coat, deep & thready pulse are signs of deficiency of yang.
