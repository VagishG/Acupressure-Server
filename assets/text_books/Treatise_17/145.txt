Shock
. Blood pressure drops so low that it often can not be measured.

e Eventually, the person cannot sit up & may die.

When shock results from excessive dilation of blood vessels, the following symp-
toms appear :

The skin may be warm & flushed in the begining of disease. The skin becomes
cold & clamms in the later stage of disease.

In the earliest stage of shock, especially septic shock, many symptoms may be
absent or may be undetected unless they are especially looked for.

In older people the only symptom may be confusion. The blood pressure is very
low.

Urine flow is very reduced because the blood supply to the kidneys is reduced.
Waste products build up in the blood.

If uncontrolled, shock is usually fatal.
The likelihood of death due to shock after a massive heart attack or due to
septic shock, especially in older people is great.

A person who is in shock should be laid down and kept warm, with legs
elevated about 12 to 24 inches to facilitate the return of blood to the heart.

Any bleeding should be stopped and breathing should be checked.

The head should be turned to the side to prevent inhalation of vomit.

Nothing should be given by mouth.

Attempt should be made to increase blood pressure by acupressure treatment.
Bleeding, if any must be stopped immediately.

When shock is caused by an inadequate pumping action of the heart, efforts
are made to improve the hearts performance.

Shock caused by excessive dilation of the blood vessels is treted primarily with
points that construct the blood vessels. The cause of the excessive dilation is
also treated. For example, a bacterial infection is treated to treat the dilated
vessels.

Traditional chinese concept of shock :

In shock there is exhaustion of the vital body function.
It is caused when the strength of yin & yang is very much depleted.
