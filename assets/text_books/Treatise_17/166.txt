Normally the brain can quickly adjust its own levels of activity and conciousness as
needed. The system of nerve cells and fibers that controls conciousness or arousal levels
is located deep within the brain stem. It is called reticular activating system.

The brain's ability to adjust its activity and conciousness levels can be impaired due to
certain damages to the brain.

Stupor (hypersomnia) is an excessively long or deep sleep like state from which a
person can be awakened only briefly by vigourous stimulation, such as repeated shaking

(f&cIFM), loud calling (SIX B YHRAM), pinching (det Brea) or sticking with a pin (fF YAM).

“Coma is a state of complete unresponsiveness, from which a person cannot be aroused
at all. A person in coma lacks even the most basic response, such as avoidance of pain,
although reflexes may be present.
