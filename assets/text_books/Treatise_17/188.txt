Recovery from coma is likely when the cause is an overdose of a sedative.
When the cause is low blood sugar level, complete recovery is possible, if the

When the cause is head injury, substantial recovery may occur even if the
coma lasted for several weeks (but not if it lasts more than 3 months).
