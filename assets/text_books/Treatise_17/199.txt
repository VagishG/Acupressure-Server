When the cause is cardiac arrest or oxygen deprivation, full recovery rarely
occurs, if after one week, the person can not move the limbs when asked to do
so.

A vegetative state may result after severe brain damage due to head injury or
oxygen deprivation.

In such cases the cerebrum, which controls thought & behaviour is destroyed.
But the thalamus & brain stem which control sleep cycles, body temperature,
breathing and heart rate are spared.

People in this state often open their eyes and they have relatively normal
sleeping & waking patterns, breath & swallow. However they loose all capacity
for conscious thought & behaviour. If such vegetative state persists for more
than a few months, recovery of conciousness is unlikely.

The locked in state is a rare condition in which person is concious & able to
think but are severely paralysed. They communicate only by opening & closing
the eyes in response to questions. Here brain stem is affected but the cer-
ebrum is working.

Brain death most severe form of coma. In this case the brain has permanently
lost the ability to perform all vital functions, including maintenance of breathing
such person is legally dead.
