Electroencephalography (EEG) helps diagnose seizure disorders :

e EEG is a recording of the brain's electrical activity.

° The procedure is simple & painless.

e About 20 small adhesive electrodes are placed on the scalp and the
brains activity is recorded under normal conditions.

° Then the person is exposed to various stimuli, such as bright or flashing
lights, to try to provoke a seizure.

e During a seizure, electrical activity in the brain accelerates, producing a
jigjag wave pattern.

e —— Such recordings of brain waves help identify a seizure disorder.

. Different types of seizures have different wave patterns.

Normal Brain wave Absence seizure Tonic-clonic seizure
Doctors examine the recording of EEG for evidence of abnormal electrical
discharges.

Abnormal discharges occur after too little sleep. If a person is deprived of
sleep for 18 to 24 hours abnormal discharge occur.

Routine blood tests are performed to measure the levels of sugar, calcium and

sodium in the blood and to determine whether the liver and kidneys are functioning

properly.

A high white blood cell count may indicate an infection.

Alowred blood cell count (anemia) may indicate are inadequate supply of oxygen

to the brain.

ECG is performed to rule out an abnormal heart rhythm as a possible cause of

symptoms. An abnormal heart rhythm can reduce blood flow and therefore the
oxygen supply to the brain. It can trigger seizure and cause loss of conciousness.

CT Scan or MRI of the head is usually performed to check the structural damage
to the brain tissue.

Sometimes a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is needed to determine whether the
person has an infection of the layers of tissue covering brain (meningitis) or of

the brain (encephalitis).
