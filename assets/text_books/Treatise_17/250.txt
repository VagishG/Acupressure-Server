According to TCM, epilepsy is caused by kidney and liver yin deficiency. Defi-
cient kidney yin causes internal wind in the liver and the phlegm goes up with
wind to the mind, disrupts the Qi in the meridians & confuses the mind & causes
epilepsy.

Another cause of epilepsy is the excess phlegm rebels upwards, the qi in the
head ecomes disorderly, the vessels close and sense orfices become discon-
nected with the result that the ears do not hear sounds, the eyes do not recog-
nise people and the person becomes dizzy & collapses.

The treatment is directed towards clearing the orfices of the sense organs in
head, transforming the phlegm and calming the liver the clearing the wind.
