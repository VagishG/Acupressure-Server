A stroke is a cerebrovascular disorder. Cerebro means brain and vascular means
blood vessels.

There are two types of strokes :

1) Ischemic stroke 3Rtbdsra Sart

2) Hemorrhagic stroke <ealdsifyadt Sere

1) Ischemic stroke Hktthdlsta Ste :

Anischemic stroke is the death of brain tissue cerebral infarction resulting from
an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to the brain.

Ischemic stroke is due to blocked artery. The brain cells are deprived of their
blood supply, and they do not receive adequate oxygen and glucose, which are
carried by blood.

A ministroke is often an early warning sign of an impending ischemic stroke.

Ministroke is caused by an inadequate supply to part of the brain but only fora

brief time. As the blood supply is restored quickly, brain tissue does not die.
2) Hemorrhagic stroke weld sa Sead :

A hemorrhagic stroke is damage to brain tissue resulting from bleeding inside
the skull.

20% of the strokes are hemorrhagic ie, due to bleeding in or around the brain. In
this type of stroke, a blood vessel ruptures. The blood leaks into brain tissue
and causes scar. This scar leads to seizures.
