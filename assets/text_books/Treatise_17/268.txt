Windstroke :

If an artery supplying the area of the brain that controls the left legs muscle
movements is blocked, the leg becomes weak or paralysed.
If the area of the brain that senses touch to the right arm is damaged sensation
in the right arm is lost.
Early treatment can help recoup the loss of function and sensation. Starting
treatment within 3 to 6 hours can prevent the more severe consequences of a
stroke.
When the branch of the internal carotid artery is affected, blindness in one eye
or weakness in one arm or leg or one side of the body may happen.
When the branch of vertebral artery in the back of the brain is affected, dizzi-
ness and vertigo, double vision or generalised weakness of both sides of the
body are more common.
Strokes can cause swelling in the brain due to accumulation of fluids edemas.
Swelling in the brain is dangerous because the skull does not expand. It causes
herniation of the. brain... .
MRI can detect ischemic strokes within minutes of their start.
CT can detect ischemic strokes within one hour of their start.
CT Scan or MRI also helps distinguish an ischemic stroke from a hemorrhagic
stroke, a brain tumor, an abscess and other structural abnormalities.
Identifying the precise cause of stroke whether the blockage is a blood clot or
fatty deposit is important.
If the blockage is a blood clot, another stroke can take place.
Blood clots may form in the heart, if itis beating irregularly. Treating the irregular
heart beat can prevent new clots form forming and causing another stroke.

Blood tests are performed to be sure that the stroke was not caused by a
deficiency of R.B.C. (anemia) polycythemia, cancer of the WBC (leukemia) or
an infection.

Treatment :

When a person with stroke arrives, first of all restore person's breathing, heart
tate, blood pressure and temperature to normla.

Fluids are given if the blood pressure is low.
