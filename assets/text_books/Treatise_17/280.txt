Dizziness is faintness or lightheadedness in which a person feels about to lose
conciousness, loss of balance in which a person feels unsteady and about to fall.

Dizziness may be temporary or chronic. Chronic dizziness is more common among
older people. It affects about 40% of people older than 40 at some time.

Faintness and light headedness may result from a sudden fall in blood pressure.
Inadequate blood supply to the brain may cause dizziness. Anxiety disorders & abnormally
rapid breathing may also cause light headedness. Loss of balance may result from muscle
weakness.

Disorders of inner ear can cause vertigo. Inner ear enable the body to maintain balance.
Motion sickness may develop in people whose inner ear is sensitive to particular motions,
such as swaying or sudden stopping or starting.

Vertigo may be caused by damage to nerves in the neck. This type of vertigo is called
cervical vertigo. Intracranial hypertension may cause vertigo.
