Fainting is a sudden, brief loss of conciousness. Inadequate supply of oxygen & other
nutrients to the brain caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow in turn causes fainting.

Causes of fainting aaieh & ora:

1) Very low blood pressure Ã©F1 W dete 3 aad 2
Fainting may occur if the heart cannot pump sufficient blood to maintain a nor-
mal blood pressure. In other words very low blood pressure causes fainting.

2) DARA UT AA GRA TA eet eas SI uel ori aman SB an wad VI
An abnormal heart rhythm or a heart valve disorder may impair the hearts
pumping ability.
People with such disorders may feel fine when resting. However, they may feel
pain or acutally faint when exercising because the heart can not pump enough
blood to meet the body's increased demand of oxygen.
This type of fainting is called exertional or effort syncope.

People may faint after exercise. During exercise the heart rate increases. The
increased heart rate may enable the heart to pump enough blood to maintain
adequate blood pressure. When exercise stops, the heart rate begins to de-
crease and the amount of blood pumped begins to decrease. However, the
blood vessels in the muscles which dilate during exercise to move more blood
to and from muscles, remain dilated.

The arterioles in muscles remain dilated to help supply oxygen and nutrients to
muscle tissue.

The veins in muscles remain dilatec to remove metabolic waste products
produced during exercise.

The decrease in the amount of blood pumped out combined with dilation of
arterioles & veins causes the blood pressure to fall. It resutls in fainting.

An abnormality of the heart called hypertrophied cardiomyopathy can also cause
fainting.
Such fainting usually occurs during exercise.
