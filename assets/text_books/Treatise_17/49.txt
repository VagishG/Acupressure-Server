Fibroids in the uterus are the most common noncancerous tumor of the female
reproductive tract.

Uterus fibroids occur in one fourth of the white women and one half of the black women.
Fibroids may be very small or as large as basket ball.

Fibroids may develop in the walls inside the uterus.
Fibroids may develop on the walls outside the uterus.
Usually, more than one fibroid is present.

Large fibroids that grow on the walls of inside or outside the uterus, can distort the
shape of the uterus.

Symptoms ma :
i) Fibroids commonly cause menstrual bleeding to be heavier or to last longer
than usual.

ii) Anemia may result from the loss of blood.

iii) Sometimes fibroids cause bleeding between menstrual periods, after sexual
intercourse or after menopause.

iv) Rarely fibroids cause infertility by blocking the fallopian tubes.
v) Rarely cancerous tumors that resemble fibroids develop in the uterus.
