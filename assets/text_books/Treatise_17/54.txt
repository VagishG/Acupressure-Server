Leprosy

Areas affected by this rash are numb because the bacteria damages the
underlying nerves.

Lepromatous leprosy :

In this type of leprosy, many small lumps or larger raised rashes of variable
size and shape appear on the skin.

There are more areas of numbness than in tuberculoid leprosy and certain
muscle groups may be weak.

Borderline leprosy :

In this type of leprosy, features of both tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy are
found.

The most severe symptoms of leprosy result from infection of peripheral nerves.
It causes a deterioration of sense of touch and corresponding inability to feel
pain and temperature.

People with peripheral nerve daman* =" Â« ey

nowingly burn, cut or otherwise
harm themselves.

Repeated damage may eventually lead to loss of fingers and toes

6) Damage to peripheral nerves may cause muscle weakness. Muscle weak-
ness may result in clawing of the fingers and foot drop deformity

Te) Skin infection can lead to areas of swelling and lumps, particularly disfiguring
the skin of the face.

8) People with leprosy may develop sores on the soles of the feet

9) Damage to the nasal passage can result in a chronically stuffy nose, if

untreated, there can be complete erosion of the nose.
Eye damage may lead to blindness

Men with lepromatous leprosy may experience erectile dysfunction (impotence)
It is due to the infection reducing the amount of testosterone and sperms
produced by the testes

In leprosy, the body's immune response may produce inflammatory reactions.
These reactions may produce fever and inflammation of the skin, peripheral
nerves and lymph nodes, joints, testes, kidneys, liver and eyes
