Antibiotic treatment can stop the progression of leprosy but does not reverse
any nerve damage or deformity. Antibiotic therapy must continue for a long
period of months to many years or life time.

Early detection & treatment are vitally important.

The BCG vaccine, which is used to prevent tuberculosis offers some protec-

For cases of long duration wherein the numbness is quite severe, sedation
should be done for 8 to 12 hours a day.

For less severe cases sedation should be done for 4 to 8 hours a day.
This treatment should be given for 15 to 30 days.

The patient with infectious leprosy should be treated in isolation so that the
disease does not spread.
