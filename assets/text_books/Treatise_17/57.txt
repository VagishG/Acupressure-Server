The damage caused by frostbite results from :

ousattra afer Prafead ates a etc é :

1) Because cold causes blood vessels to narrow.

2) Tissue near the frozen area may be damaged due to decreased blood flow.

3) Sometimes cold also causes clots to form in small blood vessels in this tissue.
These clots may limit blood flow and the tissue die.

4) When the blood flow returns to the affected area the damaged tissue release a
number of chemical substances that promote inflammation. Inflammation
worsens the damage caused by cold.

5) Toxic substances are released into the blood stream as frozen tissue is warmed.

6) These toxic substances may cause irregular heart rhythms. Hence, doctors
monitor heart function and blood levels of these toxins.

7) The risk of frostbite damage depends on how cold it is and how long the part
was exposed.

8) Those who have poor circulation due to diabetes or arteriosclerosis, blood ves-
sel spasms or construction of blood flow by gloves or shoes that are too tight
are at greatest risk of developing frostbite.

9) Exposed hands, feet and face are most vulnerable.

Symptoms of frostbite ovesific aifa & creat :

1) Shallow frostbite results ina numb white patch of skin that peels after warming.

2) Slightly deeper frostbite causes blisters (wc) and swelling of the affected
area.

3) Deeper freezing causes the extrimity to feel numb, cold & hard. The area is
pale & cold. Blisters often appear.

4) The extremity may become gray & soft (wet gangrene). If vwet gangrene
appears ir: many cases the extrimity must be amputed.

5) More frecuently the area becomes black & leathery (dry gangrene).
