Myasthenia Gravis (ait dit fer)

Myasthenia gravis is an auto immune disorder in which communication between nerves
& muscles is impaired, resulting in episodes of muscle weakness.

In myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies that attack one type of
receptor on the muscle side of the neuromuscular junction.

What causes the body to attack its own receptors is unknown. A malfunction of
thymus gland may be involved.

In thymus gland certain cells of the immune system learn how to differentiate between
the body and foreign substances. When the thymus gland instructs the immune system
cells to produce antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors, a myasthenia gravis
may result.

About 10% of the people who have myasthenia gravis have a tumor of the thymus
gland. About half of the thymus tumors are cancerous.
