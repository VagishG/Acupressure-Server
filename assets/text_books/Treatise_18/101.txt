ii) | Emptycold conditions :
a) Empty cold conditions arise from deficiency of yang Qi.
b) In empty cold conditions the tongue will be pale with thin white coating

and overly moist.

. The tongue is pale as the deficient yang Qi fails to carry Qi & blood to the
tongue.

. The coating is thin as the condition arises from deficiency.

e The coating is white because of cold.

e The tongue is overly moist because deficient yang Qi fails to transform & transport.

iii) Full cold conditions :

. Full cold conditions arise from excess of yin or excess of cold.

. Either external or internal full cold conditions is indicated on the tongue as pale
tongue with thick white coating which is overly moist & possibly slippery.

Reasoning :

. The tongue body is pale because excess cold obstructs the circulation of yang
Qi, which then can not carry blood to tongue.

e The coating is thick. Thick coating indicates excess condition.
e The coating is white it indicates cold.
e The coating is overly moist or slippery.

It is due to the reason the cold obstructs the circulation of yang Qi. Yang qi fails
to transform & transport the fluids, which the accumulate on the tongue.
