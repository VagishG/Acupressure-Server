"The tongue is the offshoot of heart, hence its colour is red, its body is moist (44), its
surface is thin as hair without thorns (@i2), its coating is thin & white."

The tongue colour reflects the health of the internal organs, blood and nutritive Qi.

From pattern identification, it reflects the hot and cold conditions, yin & yang conditions
