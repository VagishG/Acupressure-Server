A pale and dry tongue can also indicate a completely different pattern.

If both lungs Qi and spleen yang are deficient, the stomach can not generate fluids.
The spleen can not transform and transport these fluids. Lung Qi can not disperse
these fluids. When the fluids can not reach the tongue, it becomes dry. In this case the
dryness of tongue is not due to deficient blood, but is due to deficient yang.

Thus deficient yang Qi can be indicated by either a wet or dry tongue, although the
former is more common.

It can not be inferred from a pale dry tongue alone whether the condition is due to blood
deficiency or yang deficiency.

Yang deficiency with a dry tongue is more serious than the yang deficiency with a wet
tongue.

Main symptoms of spleen yang deficiency :

Lack of appetite

Loose stools

Coldness of limbs

Chilliness

Abdominal distension

Lassitude

Abright white complexion

Adeep, weak pulse

Apale, dry tongue is also caused by lungs Qi deficiency. In this case following symp-
toms will appear :

Shortness of breath

Aweakened voice

In severe cases there may be accumulation of fluids in the abdomen and a dry mouth
and tongue resulting from fluids accumulating in the lower warmer and being depleted
in the upper warmer.
