A red tongue indicates heat. Since the heat dries the body fluids, the tongue
becomes dry.

Ared and wet tongue indicates heat in nutritive Qi level and retention of dampness.

When there is liver fire making a tongue red and a deficient spleen Qi forming
dampness, the tongue is red and wet.

STaRG Bl SWAT ufee f& liver yang rising or liver fire causes spleen Qi
deficiency. Liver is the controller of spleen. Liver fire subdues spleen Qi.
When yang Qi is extremely deficient there is red & wet tongue. This condition is
rare.

When yang Qi is extremely deficient, yin and yang energies separate so that
whatever little yang remain in the body, it floats upwards and makes the tongue
red. The deficient yang fails to transform & transport fluids so that they
accumulate on the tongue and make it wet. This is a condition of true cold
reflected as wetness of the tongue & false heat reflected in the redness of the
tongue. In this case the tongue will also be flaccid & soft due to yang deficiency.
A red tongue which is slightly moist, is a favourable indication. Red tongue
indicates heat. Slightly moist tongue indicates that the heat has not dried the
fluids, thereby indicating that the heat is of recent origin only.
