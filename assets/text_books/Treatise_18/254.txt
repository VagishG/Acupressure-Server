Partially swollen tongue afer qh sft:
There are several types of partially swollen tongues.
The partially swollen tongue may be due to deficiency or excess.

In conditions of deficiency the swelling is due to a deficiency of Qi, which in turn causes
fluids to acumulate.

In conditions of excess, the swelling is due to excess of Qi or stagnant Qi, which
accumulates in the tongue.

If the tongue is pale, the swelling is from deficiency.

If the tongue is red or purple, the swelling is from excess.

A tongue swollen on the edges, with swelling that is large and fat and more in the
middle section of the tongue is generally of pale or normal colour and is due to defi-
ciency of spleen Qi or spleen yang.

of the tongue.
