Tongue is important in serious internal organ problems :

i) If the tongue is dark red, peeled & cracked. This definitely denotes that the
internal organs have been seriously affected by the emotional stress over a
long period of time.

ii) If a person is very tense, anxious and distraught and the pulse is rapid, if the
tongue is not red, the tongue body not abnormal & the coating not very thick,
then the emotional stress has not very seriously affected the internal organ.
The problem is still at the level of Qi rather than nutritive Qi or blood.

See the tongue distinguish between allergic and non-allergic asthama.

i) In allergic asthama, the tongue body is not swollen.

ii) In non allergic asthama the tongue body is quite swollen.

Allergic asthama is not due to phlegm. Non allergic asthama is due to phlegm.

In both allergic and non allergic type of asthama, the internal organs are affected.
Lungs & spleen are seriously distressed by the presence of phlegm. In allergic asthama
the lungs & spleen are affected in late stage.
