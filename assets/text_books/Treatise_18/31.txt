Dangerous tongue
aaeTs sit

Some tongues indicate serious conditions. These types of tongue indicate imminent
death. More so if the dangerous tongue symptoms appear suddenly during an attack

disease.

Dangerous tongue denotes total collapse of yin or yang.
Collapse of yin conditions :

1)
2)

3)

4)

If there is no tongue coating and the tongue looks like a mirror, this is due to
heat injuring yin or to collapse of stomach Qi.

If the tongue appears like a patch of fish scales, has prickles and is dry & with-
ered with cracks, it is caused by exhaustion of body fluids.

Awhite, moldy tongue coating indicates kidney & stomach yin deficiency lead-
ing to heat, with damp toxins inside. This condition is found in chronic diseases
of long duration.

When the tongue is red in the middle and black on the sides, collapse of kidney
yin is indicated.

Collapse of yang condition:

1)

2)

If the tongue is pale and the coating is like snow flakes, it indicates collapse of
spleen yang.

A blue tongue without coating is always a sign of danger.

The blue tongue indicates cold congealed insides with stasis of blood. The
abscence of coating here denotes total collapse of Qi & blood. This is one of the
rare cases in which the absence of coating is due to extreme deficiency of yang
rather than deficiency of yin.

Extreme problems of either yin or yang :

1)

Ablack, dry and cracked tongue usually indicates a severe, dangerous wither-
ing and exhaustion of kidney yin.

However, in rare cases this coating can arise from true cold in the interior with
yang deficiency, even though the tongue is dry. Here, the yang Qi can not move
& evaporate the fluids, which makes the coating dry.
