i)

Tongue becomes purple or it develops purple spots within one week of bone
fracture.

After the reunion of the fractured bone the purple colour disappears.

In young people reunion of bone is faster and so the purple colour disappears
faster.

In old people it takes more time.

In persons below 20 may not develop a purple tongue at all.

If the tongue becomes red and peeled after a bone fracture, it indicates poor
prognosis. The patient may have pain in the fractured bone and the bone may
not mend well. In such cases tongue becomes red & peeled due to stagnant
blood turning into heat and injuring yin.
