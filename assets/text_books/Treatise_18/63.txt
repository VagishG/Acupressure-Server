e The greater yang channel (Si/ UB) governs the exterior of the body.
. This is most superficial channel.

. This channel is rich in supply of defensive Qi. The function of the defensive Qi
is to resist attack of external pathogenic factors.

. When wind cold attacks the body, the greater yang channel is first to be affacted.

. The attack of external wind cold hinders the circulation of defensive Qi. This
causes pain & stiffness in head & neck at the occipit, where the greater yang
channel flows.

. Struggle between external wind cold and defensive Ci results in fever.

. Presence of wind cold in the muscles causes aversion to cold.

In treatment, it is important to distinguish between attacks of cold and attacks of wind.

Treatment of cold and wind are different.
