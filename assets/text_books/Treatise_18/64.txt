is less intense and only occurs
when a person is outdoors

e The pulse is slow as the body's Qi
is weak

e The pulse is floating as the body's
Qi goes outward to fight the
pathogenic factor

Attack of cold

Cold predominates over wind

Main symptoms

Fever

Absence of sweating

Pronounced shivers

Aversion to cold (It occurs even if a person
is midoor)

Pain & stiffness in head & neck

Floating & tight pulse

Generalised aching in the body

Lower back pain

Shortness of breath

e There is obstruction of the defensive Qi

e The obstruction of defensive Qi closes
the pores and hence, there is no sweating.

e Cold contracts & hence pores are
contracted & there is no sweating

e Generalised body aches and lower
back pain are caused by external
cold's obstruction of the circulation of
defensive Qi.

e Contraction caused by cold impairs the
lung's descending function and leads
to shortening of breath.

e The pulse is floating because the
body's Qi goes outwards to fight the
pathogenic cold.

e The pulse is tight due to contracting
nature of cold.
