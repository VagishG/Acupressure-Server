People with Parkinson's disease have difficulty walking, especially taking the
first step.

Once started they often shuffle taking short steps without swinging their arms
as they walk.

While walking some people have difficulty stopping or turning.

When the disease is advanced, some people suddenly stop walking because
they feel as if their feet are glued to the ground.

Other people unintentionally quicken their steps as if running to avoid falling.

Posture becomes stooped and balance is difficul: to maintain, leading to a
tendency to fall forward.

The face becomes less expressive because the facial muscles that control
expressions do not move.

The face can take on a blank stare with the mouth open and the eyes may not
blink often.

Often people drool or choke because muscle rigidity in face & throat makes
swallowing difficult.

Malnutrition & delirium can result.

People with Parkinson's disease often speak softly ina monotone & may stutter.
Constipation may develop.

Intellect remains normal.
