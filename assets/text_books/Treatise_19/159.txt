Urticaria (fit seer)

Urticaria is a skin reaction characterised by pale, slightly elevated swellings.
These pale, slightly elevated swellings are called wheals.

These wheals one surrounded by an area of redness with clearly defined borders.
Urticaria is also called Hives. It can be severe.

Urticaria is due to allergic reaction of the body to drugs, insect stings or bites, certain
foods particularly eggs, shellfish, nuts and fruits.

Eating even a tiny amount of some foods can suddenly result in urticaria.

But with other foods such as Strawberries, these reaction occur only after a large
amount is eaten.

Also Hives sometimes follow viral infections such as Hepatitis, Measles etc.
Urticaria can be chronic recurring over weeks or months.

In most cases no specific cause is identified. The cause may be habitual, uninten-
tional intake of a substance - for example a food preservative or food dye.

In some people antibodies to thyroid hormone may be the cause.

Use of certain drugs such as aspirin or other non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDS) can cause urticaria.

Symptoms & Diagnosis of Urticaria :

Urticaria usually begins with itching then wheals quickly develop. The wheals usually
remain small i.e. less than Qâ€™7".

It may look like rings of redness with a pale centre.
Crops of lives come & go.
One spot may remain for several hours, then disappear.

Later another spot may appear elsewhere. After the hive disappears, the skin usually
looks completely normal.

In children when hives appear suddenly, disappear quickly and do not recur.
G Treatment of urticaria in allopathy :

Usually the urticaria appears suddenly and they subside without any treatment within
days and sometimes within minutes.

For hives antihistamines relieves the itching and reduces the swelling.
