The patient should restrict the salt consumption to 5 gms per day.

Asmall amount of salt is essential for health. It tonifies kidneys.

In excess, salt harms the kidneys and the heart. It dries blood. This drying effect
can cause further derangement of body fluids and can aggravate edema. The
water intake should also be restricted to 1 to 1% Itr per day. Excess water to
intake increases workload on sick kidneys. Many people erroneously believe
that drinking large amounts of fluid "flushes" the kidney. All that it does it to put
an extra strain on the kidney. It weakens kidney.

Acute nephritis usually starts with symptom of an external attack of wind water
on lungs with edema of face & eyes.

External humid heat may attack spleen and stomach and impair their function
of transforming & transporting fluids. Hence, the fluids stagnate and are
retained under the skin causing edema. This is not a common cause of edema
in hot elimates.

External damp coldness may attack the body and if it remains for a long period,
it causes edema.

Irregular eating, too much dairy products and greasy foods impair the spleens
function of transforming & transporting fluids. This cause edema.

Excessive sexual activity and overwork weaken the kidneys weak kidney can
not properly transform fluids, leading to edema.

Carbuncles, sores, furuncles produce fire poison. It may not clear and excrete
the turbidity from the space between skin and muscle. It leads to retention of
fluids and causes edema.
