Exysipelas (thea 1 3em)

Erysipelas is one form of Strepto Cocial cellulitis in which tne skin is bright red, swol-
len and the edges of the infected area are raised. The swelling occurs because the infec-
tion blocks lymphatic vessels of the skin.

Allon a sudden the skin develops a well defined patch of inflammation which is deep
red and slightly raised.

Pressing of the affected skin reduces the redness, which returns promptly upon
release.

There may be vesicles or bullas. There is burning pain. There is no supurations.

The regional lymph nodes become swollen and tender.
