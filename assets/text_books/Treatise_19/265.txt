Gall bladder stones are formed due to two reasons :

i) When there is an excess of cholestrol in the blood, it may cause gall bladder
stones.

ii) When there is a shortage of bile acids it may also cause gall bladder stones.
Both cholestrol and bile acids are controlled by liver.

Free flow of liver Qi is needed to maintain normal bile acids.

Stagnation of liver Qi hinders the free flow of bile from the liver & gall bladder & may
cause gall bladder stones.

When the liver Qi stagnates, the bile is not secreted properly or it is secreted insuffi-
ciently, it causes accumulation of humid heat in gall bladder.

Action of heat and humidity in the long period of time of cause formation of stones.
Gall bladder stones are of three types :

1) Cholestrol stones

2) Pigment stones

3) Mixed stones

Cholestrol stones :

Cholestrol stones are made up of cholestrol.

These are usually single stones.

Humid-heat in liver & gall bladder causes these stones.
Pigment stones :

Pigment stones are composed of bile pigments.

They are always numerous in numbers.

They are less common.

Mixed stones :

These stones are made up of cholestrol, calcium & bilirubin. These are most
common types of stones.
