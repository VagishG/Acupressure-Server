Qi masses are much easier to disperse than blood masses.

Ovarian cyst and uterine myomas can be despersed only if they are very small
(not more than 2 cm in diameter).

There are three types of fibroids :

i)  Subserous fibroid (on the outside of the wall of the uterus).

ji) _ Interstitial fibroid (within the wall of the uterus).

ii) | Sub mucous fibroid (on the inside of the uterus).

The interstitial myomas are the easiest to disperse by Acupressure treatment.
Malignant tumors of the abdomen can be treated by Acupressure and progno-
sis varies according to the organ involved & the stage of carcinoma.

Of all tumors, the lymphomas respond best to Acupressure treatment.
Masses due to enlargement of organs can be dispersed by Acupressure treat-
ment. The treatment will necessarily take a long time and patience is required
from the patient and the Acupressure therapist.
