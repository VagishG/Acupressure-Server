How is the constipation diagnosed ?

In acupressure we diagnose the cause of constipation by examining the stool as follows:

2) Stool which is round and small like pebbles (Ã©s) indicate liver Qi stagnation if

itis not dry.

carcinoma of the bowel.

water is due to heat.

deficiency of yin.

stagnation of liver Qi.

indicates humid heat.
