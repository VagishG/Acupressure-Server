At the time of treatment it is observed that when problem is maximum or minimum.
For example if there is breathing problem at the time 3-5 AM maximum, it can be due to
excess energy in Lungs so sedate Lungs Qi. If there is a problem of breathing 3 PM to 5 PM.
It may be due to minimum energy. Thus Lungs energy should tonify.

Organ Month : In rainy seasons rivers are over flow or flooded in the same way
energy of the meridians also over flow in the meridian month. In anti meridian month the

eneray will be minimizes esoe2s 22a art DE|OW
