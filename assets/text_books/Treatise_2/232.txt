xi) Listening is a Skill:
Speech is like silver, silence is like gold
Learned for years to read, write & speak
On so much so, still friends, not learnt listening yet
Respected a lot speech, now will respect ears
Guru speaks & disciple listens
Patient speaks & therapist listens
Society speaks & ruler listens
Commander speaks & battlemen listen
Customer speaks & seller listens
Depressed speaks & healer listens
Angry speaks & calm listens
Capable speaks & receiver listens
Whenever | listen to you, | give you respect
Whenever | don't listen to you, | develop pride
One speech gives knowledge to lacs
But receives only those who can lend ears to speech
Speaker is in bond age, listener is free
There is fear of wrong speech & forgetfulness in speaking
Listener is free of fear
Spoken words are not returned
But listened words are forgotten
Speech can benefit others
But listening benefits oneself.
So, speech is like silver
and silence is like gold
xii) Saying No:
Consider automatic yes
Say, fearful no
