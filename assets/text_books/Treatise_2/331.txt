The use of this treatment :

a) According to (i) Chart H 8, P 8 tonifies Sp 3 and sedates Liv 1.

So if there is numbness is near Sp 3 than treatment can be given on H 8 or P 8,
If there is pain near Liv 1, treatment should be given on H 8 or P 8 for relief.

b) Treat Liv 1 if fire element is deficient in body. If earth element deficient, treat
H8,P 8. If metal element is deficient, treat Sp 3. If water element is deficient, treat
Lu8. If wood element is deficient treat K 10

Subjugation or Control or Destructive or Endanger or Ko Cycle :

Fire melts metal, Metal cuts wood, Wood (forest) covers earth and earthen dams
control water. Hence Fire is controller of Metal, Metal is controller of wood, Wood is controller
of earth, Earth is controller of Water.

Treatment on Own Element Points is done according to the chart given on the next
page.

Theory of Treatment :

Water controls fire, so K 10 depresses H 8, P 8, UB 66 depresses Si5, Tw6

Fire melts metal so H8, P 8 depresses Lu 8, Si 5, Tw6 depresses Li 1

Metal cuts wood so Lu 8 depresses Liv 1, Li 1 depresses GB 41

Wood covers earth so Liv 1 depresses Sp 3, GB 41 depresses St 36

Earthen dams control water so Sp 3 depresses k 10, St 36 depresses UB 66
