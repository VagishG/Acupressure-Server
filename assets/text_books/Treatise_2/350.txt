Internal Disease

Itis writen in “Yellow Emperor's Classics”.

We can compare the disease of five yin organ with a needle, pierced in body, spots on
chair, knot in rope, sand and dirt in river. But the pierced needle can be removed, the dark
spots ona chair can be cleaned or a knot in a rope can be deknot or a river can be cleaned
by removing mud or sand from it, no matter how old there problems are. Though some
persons think that its not possible to cure chronic diseases. But its not true, an expert can
treat and cure chronic diseases. A therapist is not an expert who thinks chronic disease

can't be cured.
