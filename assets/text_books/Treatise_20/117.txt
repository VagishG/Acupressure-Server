General principles of treatment of headache :

Reed & 30uR & wara fig :

There are three options suerte aa Fase :

i) Treating both the root (31) and manifestation (c1aT).
In most cases it is necessary to treat both the root (sig) and the manifes-
tation simultaneously.

For example :

If the headache is due to liver yang rising due to kidney yin deficiency, in this

case the root (31) is the kidney yin deficiency and the manifestation (a1) is

the liver yang rising. A treatment is given on both root & manifestation by toning
the kidney and sedating the liver yang simultaneously.

ii) Treating the manifestation (@1ai1) first & the root (31g) second.

When the headache caused by the manifestation is very severe &
frequent, first treat the manifestation only ie, sedate liver yang.
When the severity & frequancy of the headache have been reduced,
then start treating root also.

deficiency type i.e., deficiency of Qi or blood. Here the root is the
deficiency of Qi or blood.

Treat the root ie, tonify Qi or blood.
