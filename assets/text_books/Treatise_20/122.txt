Causes of disease 1 &T GRU:

i) Wind cold combines with dampness and attacks the body. Dampness obstructs
the clear orfices (ff5x UT aIX) of the head and causes headache with heaviness
of head & body. The head feels as if it is wrapped in a cloth. This sensation
aggravates in damp weather.

ii) Dampness obstructs clear yang from reaching the head & brighten the orfices
and the turbid yin from descending. This causes typical muzzy feeling, heavy
head, poor concentration and heavy eyes.

Treatment principles 37a Fegret :

i) Expel wind

ii) Resolve dampness

iii) Release the exterior

iv) Remove obstruction from the meridians
