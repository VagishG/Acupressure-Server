Excessive mental work 3rafte afte ord :

Excessive mental activity may cause chronic headaches in children

When a bright child joins an academically very high standard school with high parent
expectations, the child has to do long hours of mental work and concentration com-
bined with the worry of doing well. This causes the severe headaches or migraine.
The long hours of work at a computer moniter strains the eyes and leads to riead-
aches

Overwork sified :

Working too long hours without sufficient rest weakness the spleen Qi

In the long run overwork weakens kidney yin.

The deficiency of kidney yin causes headaches in the whole head.

The deficiency of kidney yin may lead to liver yang rising and this in turn causes
migraine headache on one side of head on the Gall bladder meridian.

Excessive sexual activity 3ife astm ffoar :

Sexual activity causes the temporary loss of kidney-essence. The kidney-essence is
quickly restored and hence, the sexual activity does not cause disease

But when the sexual activity is very frequent, the kidney essence can not be restored
fully. This causes deficiency of kidney yin or kidney yang depending upon the person's
constitution.

Men are affected by sexual activity more than women.

Too many child births weaken the uterus and the kidneys in women. This is a very
important cause of deficiency of kidney essence in women.

Deficiency of kidneys due to excessive sexual activity, causes headaches either on
the occiput or the whole head.

If one feels headache and dizziness just after the sexual activity, it indicates that the
level of sexual activity is excessive and it should be reduced.

Diet TER :

Not eating sufficient food & nutrients may cause headaches due to general deficiency
of Qi and Blood. Such headache occurs on the top of the head. People doing dieting
may develop such condition due to lack of essential nourishment.
