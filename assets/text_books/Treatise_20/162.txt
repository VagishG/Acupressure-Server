Sinuses reduce the weight of the facial bones while maintaining bone strength and
shape. The air filled spaces of the nose and sinuses also add resonance on the voice.

The sinuses are lined with a mucous membrane composed of cells that produce
mucous and have cilia.

Incoming dirt particles are trapped by the mucous in sinuses. Cilia moves them to the

nasal cavity via the small sinus opening. The openings are very small. The drainage is
easily blocked by conditions as colds or allergies, which produce swelling of the mucous

membranes.
Blockage of normal sinus drainage leads to sinus inflammation and infections. This is
called sinusitis.
