About 10 to 15 million peoples suffer from sinusitis every year.

Sinusitis may be acute (short lived) or chronic (long lived).
1 Acute sinusitis 34 fxrart eter :

Acute sinusitis may be caused by a variety of bacteria. When something blocks the
openings of the sinus, acute sinusites may be caused. Such blockage is generally
caused by a viral infection of the upper airways. This happens in the case of common
cold. During a common cold, the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity are swollen
and they block the openings of the sinuses. Air in the sinuses is absorbed by the blood
stream and the pressure inside the sinus decreases. It causes pain and draws fluids
inside the sinuses. This fluid is breeding ground for the bacteria, W.B.C. and more
fluid enter the sinuses to fight the bacteria. This influx increases thepressure and
causes more pain.

Allergies also cause mucous membrane swelling. It blocks the openings to the
sinuses.

People with deviated septum are more prone to obstructed sinuses.

9 Chronic sinusitis sfof feta ez:
Sinusitis is called as chronic, if it has been ongoing for more than 8 to 12 weeks.
Often the person has a family history of chronic sinusitis.

Occassionally, chronic sinusitis of the maxillary sinus results when upper tooth
abscess spreads into this sinus.

Acute sinusitis causes pain, tenderness and swelling over the affected sinus.

Mazxillary sinusitis produce pain over the cheeks just below the eyes, toothache &
headache.

Frontal sinusitis produces headache over the forehead.

Ethmoid sinusitis produces pain behind and between the eyes and splitting type of
headache over the forehead.
