Attack of wind cold or wind heat causes acute breathlessness. Wind cold or
wind heat obstructs the lungs and prevents dispersion and descention of Qi.
This causes accumulation of Qi in lungs and breathlessness.

External wind is a main cause of the begining of breathlessness, which
becomes chronic in the later stage. This is specially applicable in children. The
wind lodges in lungs and causes breathlessness.

Attack of external wind and internal lungs heat or phlegm heat also causes

breathlessness.

Following inappropriate diets causes breathlessness :

i) Excessive consumption of fats, dairy foods, sweets, sugar and raw cold
foods causes formation of phelgm. This phlegm settles in the lungs. This
phlegm obstructs the descention of Qi in lungs and causes breathless-
ness. Dairy foods include milk, cheese, butter and cream.

ii) In babies, breathlessness is caused by feeding heavy foods which the
digestive system can not digest.

Emotional problems cause breathlessness. Worry (ferail), pensiviness or brood-
ing for long period of time weakens the lung and spleen. Lungs Qi becomes
obstructed and causes breathlessness. Spleen Qi becomes weak and starts
producing phlegm. Phlegm causes breathlessness.

Anger over a long period of time causes liver yang or liver fire rising. Liver yang
or liver fire attacks the lungs and stagnates the descention of lungs Qi. This is
a very common cause of breathlessness.
