Fatigue and over work over a long period of time produces kidney yin
deficiency. Deficiency of kidney yin impairs the ‘unction of receiving Qi.

excess above and deficiency below. It causes chronic breathlessness
Physical overwork, standing for too long a period regularly causes kidney
yang deficiency. Kidney yang deficiency can not r2ceive and hold Qi down
This causes chronic breathlessness.

if the lungs are the causes of breathlessness it is of excess type. If the
kidneys are the causes of breathless it is of deficient type. At times both
are to the treated.

Chronic illness after an external attack of wind, prevents lungs Qi to
descent. It causes chronic cough and breathlessness.

Breathlessness is caused by lungs and kidney primarily. Lungs govern
Qi. Lungs are always involved in breathlessness when lungs Qi fail to
descend, when it is obstructed by external wind or by phlegm or when it
is deficient.

e — The kidneys are responsible for receiving and holding Qi down.
