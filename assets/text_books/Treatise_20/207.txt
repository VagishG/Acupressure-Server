This condition occurs only in old peoples.

They suffer from chronic breathlessness.

There is deficiency of yang of lungs, kidney, and heart.

It leads to formation of phlegm and fluids. This produces expectoration of white
watery sputum.

These phlegm fluids over flow to Lungs and Heart.

In the lungs they obstruct descending of lungs Qi and aggravates breathless-
ness.

in the heart they obstruct the circulation of blood leading to pain in chest,
cyanotic colur of face, lips, nails and tongue.

Deficiency of kidney yang causes backache, knees weakness and scanty
urination
