vil) Non allergic early onset asthma is easier to treat, especially in children. It
takes only a few weeks. This disease is caused by repeated attacks of wind
causing retention of phlegm in lungs which obstructs the descending and
dispersing of lung Qi. The treatment is given for resolving the phlegm, restoring
the descending of lung's Qi and releasing the stagnation of food. Retention of
food is very common in children. It causes retentior of phlegm.

viii) Late onset asthama in adults stands in between the previous two. It is easier to
treat than allergic asthma, but more difficult than non allergic early onset
asthma for children. Late onset asthma is due to a deficiency of lungs, spleen
or kidney's or a combination of these and retention of phlegm.

ix) Treatment is given by treating the root i.e. tonifying the body's Qi and the
manifestation simultaneously i.e. resolving phlegm and restoring the
descending of lung's Qi.

x) _ It takes several months to cure. In some cases asthma is caused by liver Qi
stagantion or liver fire due to emotional strain obstructing the descending of
lungs Qi. This type of asthama is very easy to treat.
