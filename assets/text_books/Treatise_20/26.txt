It causes a deficiency of both heart yin & heart yang

After a long time the deficiency of heart yin and heart yang causes a deficiency

of kidney yang.

This can also lead to angina in the following manner.

a) â€” Deficiency of heart & kidney yang allows yin-cold and phlegm rheum to
occupy yang's place. It causes obstruction in the heart vessels this
aggravates angina

b)  Atthe same time deficiency of kidney yin may be there. This means water
fails to nourish woods and inability to aid the heart. Fire then blazes in the
heart & the liver. This fire scorches the fluids and transforms them into
phlegm.This phlegm causes angina. This phlegm injures the blood vessels
and disrupts the nourishment of blood vessels.
