Causes of disease @7 & BRT :

i) There may be a constitutional weakness of spleen and stomach

hi) Long-lasting illness weakens the spleen and stomach

iit) Weak spleen and stomach lead to inadequate production and transformation of
Qi, blood and body fluids.

iv) Inadequate production of Qi, blood and body fluids leads to poor nourishment to
muscles and tendons and causes flaccidity and weakness of the four limbs.

v) Since the spleen and the stomach provides nourishment to all four limbs, a
deficiency of these organs produces weakness and flaccidity of the four limbs.
