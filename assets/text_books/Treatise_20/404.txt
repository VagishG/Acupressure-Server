Causes of spleen Qi deficiency wher 4 sai at at & orm:

i) Improper diet, excessive fatigue or excess brooding injures the spleen.

ii) Spleen Qi deficiency leads to impairment of the spleen's ability to transport the
essences of food and drinks, so that the source of nutrients becomes
inadequate.

iii) This causes Qi deficiency and blood deficiency.

iv) The sea of blood can not fill on schedule. It causes late menstruation or
decreased menses.

v) In spleen Qi deficiency, the spleen may lose its ability to control blood so that
the Chong & Ren meridians become infirm. This may lead to early menstrua-
tion, polymenorrhea or prolonged menstruation.
