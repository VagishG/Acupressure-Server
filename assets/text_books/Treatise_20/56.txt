A weak constitution may be due to weakness since birth, chronic illness, blood
losses, excessive fatigue or excessive sex.

This causes deficiency of Qi, blood, yin or yang. Due to any of these deficien-
cies. The heart does not get adequate nourishment. This causes palpitation.

Prolonged fear or brooding (3iftre firat Bet @) also leads to heart Qi defi-
ciency. When the heart Qi is deficient in the long run heart yin also becomes
deficient. Thus the heart does not get adequate nourishment and hence, there
is palpitation.

Sometimes heart Qi stagnates allowing the phlegm to form and fire to rise.

Phlegm fire in heart mists the mind and causes palpitation.
