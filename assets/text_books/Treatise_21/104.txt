The therapists should know that if liver blood is adequate, the eyes can see properly,
the length and quality of sleep is alright, the person is knowledgeable, there is balance
between excitation and restraint in emotional life, the person has ‘vision’ and insight, courage,
capacity of planning the life and sense of direction in life happy, creative and fruitful and his
relations with others will be coordial. If the liver blood is inadequate, the same qualities
become just the reverse.
