Expressed anger, frustration and resentment with overwork and/or excessive
sexual activity over many years may cause liver yin deficiency.

Excessive loss of blood at child birth or a prolonged, excessive loss of blood if
the period are heavy, may cause this condition.

Liver yin deficiency deprives the ethereal soul of its residence. It also affects the
mind as Liver yin is the mother of Heart yin.

This causes depression, a lack of direction in life and mental restlessness.
The sleep will be broken and the patient will wake up frequently during the night.
The patient has restless dreams due to wandering of the unrooted ethereal soul
at night.

This formula is especially suited for old people with Liver yin deficiency
producing empty heat or some raising of Liver yang or Liver wind producing
tremors, high blood pressure and giddiness.
