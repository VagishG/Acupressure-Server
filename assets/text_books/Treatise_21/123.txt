vi) The mental restlessness due to fire is entirely different than restlessness due to
empty heat.

A person with empty heat will feel restlessness and anxiety especially in the
evening and endures it with silence. Person with fire with blood heat in heart feels
extreme restlessness all the time and projects it outwards to other people or
always doing something in a compulsive way.

vii) Often liver fire is transmitted to heart giving rise to heart fire. Anger makes the
heart full with blood rushing to it. With time this causes blood heat affecting the
heart and the mind.

viii) Anger with a lot of jogging, hurrying or exercising also causes Heart fire.

10) Liver Fire produces blood heat and makes a person very angry, prone to
outburst of anger, very restless, destructive and sleep disturbed by violent
dreams of fighting.
