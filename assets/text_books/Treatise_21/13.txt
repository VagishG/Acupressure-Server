Main Symptoms :

Sudden & severe shooting pain in the back radiating down to either leg
Herniation of disc between L5 and S1 causes symptoms of nerve-root irritation
of the S1 spinal nerve.

In acute cases, the back pain is severe and no position is comfortable.

The patient adapts a posture of scoliosis curving towards the side of the prolapse.
Movements of the spine are extremely restricted.

Straight leg raising is limited on the side of the root irritation & produces intense
pain.

Test is carried out as under :

Lie the patient suppine

Hold the knee straight

Lift each leg flexing at the hip

Marked impairment of the leg movement and marked pain when lift over 30Â°
indicates lumbo-sacral nerve root compression.

This is further confirmed if more pain is elicited by dorsiflexion of the foot.
Numbness of the leg will appear in a dermatome distribution.

The pain from a prolapsed disc is not due to the disc itself but to the compression
of the nerve root and dura matter.

The torn annulus fibrosus can heal the herniated nucleus pulposus can be
reabsorbed.

Disc herniation may persist for months or even years, becoming chronic. The
area of pain & other signs help us in preparing the treatment protocol.
