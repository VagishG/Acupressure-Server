Worry and pensiveness knot Qi and impairs movement of Qi.

In the long run it leads to formation of phlegm.

Secondly, the knotted Qi easily turns into fire after a long time.

Fire in turn leads to formation of more phlegm as it burns and condenses fluids.
Phlegm fire both mists and agitates the mind.

Phlegm causes mental confusion, poor memory, dizziness and loss of insight
and depression.

Fire causes agitation, mental restlessness, insomnia, heaviness in chest, anxiety,
manic behaviour.

Phlegm fire together causes manic depression.
Phlegm fire affects the stomach, heart and gall bladder.
In Heart it mists the mind and causes mental confusion.

In gall bladder it prevents the ethereal soul from returning to the liver at night,
hence the insomnia.
