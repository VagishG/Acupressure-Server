Worry and pensiveness over a long period of time weakens the Spleen and Heart.
It causes Spleen qi deficiency and heart blood deficiency.

This weakens the mind which is deprived of its residence. Thus the patient
becomes tired and depressed and finds sleep difficult.

The mind controls memory and thinking and therefore there is a poor memory,
poor concentration and slow thinking.
