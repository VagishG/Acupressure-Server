(First stage attack of wind stroke)

Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) is called wind stroke (aTe ud) in Acupressure.

Four conditions come under the term cerebrovascular accident :

1) Haemorrhage watts 4 wpara ert :
Bleeding from an cerebral artery (Afta&p @t ert) into the subarachnoid space is
called brain haemorrhage. Subarachnoid space is the space between arachnoid
and pia matter containing cerebrospinal fluid (wat 71 ga).

2) Cerebral thrombosis waftasp 4 <p SI eT ST :
Athrombus is a blood clot that forms in the lining of the artery and remains attached
to its place of origin.

The thrombus causes total or partial obstruction of a certain artery. This obstruction
causes infarction (et aferaigt) and anoxia (aifadia wt aigfel 4 eran) of the
surrounding tissue.

3) Cerebral embolism
waRaes of ert # cep & ere sera aed varel art seavher sera et SIT:

When an embolus detaches from a thrombus and occludes a cerebral artery
with consequent infaraction and anoxia of the surrounding cerebral tissue.
An embolus is a bubble of air or a piece of a thrombus that detaches from it and
travels along the arterial system eventually occluding the artery.

4) Spasm ofa cerebral vessel wakes err at toa :
Spasm of a cerebral vessel occurs when it temoprarily contracts.
This condition is the least severe.

20% cases of wind stroke are due to hemorrhage and remaining 80% cases are
due to ischemia.
