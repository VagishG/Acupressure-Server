Joints are also the places where the pathogenic factors converge after entering
the meridians, causing obstruction in the flow of Qi and hence there is local
stagnation of Qi & blood.

This stagnation causes pain & painful occlusion syndrome.

Attack of pathogenic factors becomes easy if the body is weak leading to
malnourishment of joints.

If the joints are weakened by over use due to excess work or certain sports the
attack of pathogenic factors becomes easy.

In these cases, the external pathogenic factor enter the body & settles in the
joints easily due to the pre existing condition of ceficiency of Qi & blood.
When the defensive Qi is weak the space between the skin and the muscles is
said to be ‘open’ and thus prone to attack of wind, cold & humidity.
