Bone painful occlusion syndrome :

This is a chronic condition.

At first painful occlusion syndrome develops due to any of the four types
referred above.

Continuous occlusion of the joints by the pathogenic factors causes retention
of body fluids.
The body fluids turn into phlegm which further obstructs the joints & channels.

This causes muscular atrophy and swelling & deformity of the bones of the
joints. This is extreme form of phlegm.

In this stage painful occlusion syndrome becomes an internal syndrome affecting
not only the muscles, joints & meridians, but also the internal organs.

First of all, the obstruction of the circulation of Qi, blood and body fluids caused
by phlegm may lead to stasis of blood.

The stasis of blood in the meridians further obstructs proper circulation and
therefore is another cause of further pain.

In many cases of chronic painful occlusion syndrome, stasis of blood is an
important factor.

In severe cases, muscle wasting and atrophy, tendon contracture, inability to
extend the elbow and the knee jonits may be there.

There may be generalised ankylosis and disability.
The tongue is dusky red.
The pulse is threadlike and impeded.
