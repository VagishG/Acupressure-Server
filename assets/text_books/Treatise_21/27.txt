and purpose in life. When the ethereal soul goes out of mind, the person does
not have sense of direction and purpose in life.

in its old character and on a physical level with the smooth flow of Liver Qi.
Emotional Balance (ararTeie Baer) :

a) Emotions are a normal part of life.

b) Weall experience anger, sadness, worry, fear on occasions in the course
of our life and these do not normally lead to disease.

c) Ethereal soul is responsible for maintaining a balance between excitation
(asm) and restraint (Â¥4-Fraaet) of emotional life under the leadership of
Heart and Mind.

d) Ethereal soul is responsible for the more intutive (iff West 3H BMT) and
subconcious part of mind (Wa & siraRe dara) |

It prevents the emotions from becoming excessive causing diseases.

e) The regulatory function of the etherial soul is closely related to the balance
of Liver Blood (The yin part of Liver) and Liver Qi (the yang part of Liver).

there may be night fall with dreams.

ii) _ If Liver yang is excess there will be anger
