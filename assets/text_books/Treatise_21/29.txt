If Liver - Yin is very depleted, at times, the ethereal soul may even leave the
body temporarily at night during or just before sleep. Those who suffer from
severe deficiency of Liver-Yin may experience a floating sensation in the
few moments just before falling asleep.

This is due to the ‘floating’ of the ethereal soul not rooted in yin.

If the ethereal soul is not rooted in the Liver, mind may lack movement and
inspiration. Consequently, the person becomes depressed, without aim or
dreams.

and wisdom (aqXqM).
