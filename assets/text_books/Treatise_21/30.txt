If the mind and the ethereal soul are weak, the person becomes restless
(aa), confused (fra) and chaotic (31 Zed). He is scattered and unsettled.
Such people are always full of ideas, dreams and projects but none of these
comes to fruction (cit eT) because of the chaotic state of mind.

a) Guided day - dreams are a technic used in psychotherapy whereby

the therapist sets a certain scene for the client who is asked to imagine
himself or herself in that scene and to proceed as if ina dream.

Aim of this exercise is to bypass the mind and bring psychological
material from the ethereal soul as happens in dreams.

b) In coma the mind can not function at all, yet the person is not dead.

For death to occur, not only must the mind die but the ethereal soul
must leave the body and the corporeal soul return to earth.

c) Sleep walking, during which the mind is inactive but the ethereal soul
is active, itis due to the ethereal soul wandering at night as happens in
dreams. In fact the point UB 42 (near UB 18) can be used to treat
sleep walking.
