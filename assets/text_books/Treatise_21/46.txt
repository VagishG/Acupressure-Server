When the lungs are obstructed by a pathogenic factor, the voice may be
affected and may become hoarse or it may be lost completely.

Hoarseness may be caused either by wind cold or wind heat.

Hoarseness is due to obstruction of the lung's defensive Qi by wind.

The lung is like a bell. It should be empty and should give a clear ringing sound
with clear and loud voice.

If the bell is filled up it can not ring. Similarly, when the lung's are obstructed the
voice is affected and become hoarse.
