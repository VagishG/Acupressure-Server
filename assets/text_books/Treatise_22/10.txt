Rheumatoid Arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis. Joints of hands and feet are inflammed
resulting in swelling, pain and destruction of the joint.

World wide, rheumatoid arthritis develops in about 1% of the population.

Usually rheumatoid arthritis first appears between 25 and 50 years of age, but it may
occur at any age.

Rheumatoid arthritis can occur in children. Then the disease is called juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis and the symptoms and prognosis are some what different.

Itis an autoimmune disease. Components of the immune system attack the soft tissue
that lines the joints and connective tissues in many other parts of the body such as blood
vessels and lungs.

Eventually the cartilage, bone and ligaments of the joints erode and causes deformity,
instability and scarring in the joint.

Main Symptoms Fea tart :

e — Ittypically affects multiple joints

e — Itis symetrical affecting similar joints on both side of the body

The small joints in the finger, toes, hands, feet, wrists, elbows and ankles become
inflammed first.

The inflammed joints are usually painful and often stiff, especially just after awakening.
Such stiffness generally lasts for at least 30' and often much longer or after prolonged
inactivity.

Some people feel weak and tired, especially in the afternoon.

Rheumatoid arthritis may produce a low grade fever.
Affected joints enlarge because of swelling of the soft tissue and become deformed.
Joints may freeze in one position so that they cannot bend or open fully.
