Structure of Foot
ura at warae

The human foot is an engineering marvel. It must provide stability, yet it must also be
flexible enough to accomodate uneven surfaces.

It must be strong in order to act as a rigid lever that propels the body forward with each
stride; yet it must be supple enough to absorb the impact of each step.

To do all this, the foot has 26 bones, more than 100 ligaments and 19 muscles - not
counting the 12 leg muscles that connect it to the rest of the body.

Over the course of a day, the feet are subjected to weight loads equivalent to several
hundred tons. As one ages, the feet may widen. Many foot and heel problems are aggravated
by ill fitting shoes.

Foot pain can also be a complication of diabetes, poor circulation, arthritis, gout and
obesity.

Wear well fitted shoes with soft, shock absorbent soles.

Foot and heel pains can generally be cured by acupressure treatment, but resolution
is often slow.

Treatments of various conditions of foot have been given their relevant chapter in
