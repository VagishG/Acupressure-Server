Oa A ae ST at AT

Asleeping hand or arm can be considered a temporary neuropathy.

Hand or arm falls asleep when the nerve supplying it is compressed.

Compression interferes with blood supply to the nerve, making the nerve give off
abnormal signals.

This causes a pins and needles sensation called paresthesia.

Moving the arm around relieves the compression and restores the blood supply. As a
result the nerve function restores and pins and needles sensation stop.
