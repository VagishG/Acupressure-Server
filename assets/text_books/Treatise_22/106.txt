Sleeping Foot or Leg
wa a at a a art

Asleeping foot or leg can be considered a temporary neuropathy.
Foot or leg falls asleep when the nerve supplying it is compressed.

Compression interferes with the blood supply to the nerve, making the nerve give off
abnormal signals. This causes a pins and needles sensation called paresthesia.

Moving around relieves the compression and restores the blood supply. As a result the
nerve function restores and pins and needles sensation stops.
