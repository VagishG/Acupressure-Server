Raynaud's Disease

uitata anes 1

Raynaud's disease is a condition in which the small arteries (capillaries) in the skin
constinct, cutting off blood flow to the extremities.

Hands and feet are the most common places for this to occur but ears and nose may
be affected as well.

Episodes are generally triggered by exposure to cold air or by emotional distress.

Raynaud's disease often occurs in people with a connective tissue disease such as
scleroderma, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

It also can occur in people who regularly use pneumatic drills or chain saws, which
can damage the blood vessels in hands. It is also more likely to occur in smokers.

This condition is called Raynaud's disease when it occurs without any associated
illness.

It is called Raynaud's phenomenon when it occurs in association with other medical
conditions.

Raynaud's disease first shows up in a person's late teens or early 20's . It affects
women much more frequently than men.

Main Symptoms :

When the arteries constrict the skin of the fingers or toes turns white and then biue
when the oxygen in the blood is used up.

The affected extremity also usually feels numb or pricky.

Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting into warmer air, the cappilaries dilate and blood
flow resumes.

Prevention :

The patient should protect himself from the cold with a hat, warm socks and gloves.
Stopping smoking is imperative.

Vasodilator medicines such as nifedipine and biofeedback techniques can also cause
Symptoms.
