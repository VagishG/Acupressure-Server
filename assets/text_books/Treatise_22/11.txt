The fingers may dislocate slightly from their normal position, towards the little finger on
each hand.

Swollen wrists can pinch a nerve and result in numbness or tingling due to carpal
tunnel syndrome.

Cysts may develop behind affected knees. Such cysts can rupture causing pain and
swelling in the lower legs.

30% people with rheumatoid arthritis have hard lumps called rheumatoid nodules just
under the skin usually near the sight of pressure such as back of forearm near the elbow.

Rheumatoid arthritis reduces the blood supply to tissues and may cause nerve damage
or leg sores (ulcer).

Inflammation of the pleura or pericardium or inflammation and scarring of the lung can
lead to chest pain or shortness of breath.

Some people develop swollen lymph nodes, sjogren's syndrome which consists of
dry eyes and mouth.

Diagnosis :

In 9 out of 10 people who have rheumatoid arthritis, the E. S. R. level in the blood is
increased, which suggest that the active inflammation is present.

In 70% of people with rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid factor in the blood is increased.
Rheumatoid factor is increased in other diseases, such as hepatitis and some other
infections.

Usually the higher the level of rheumatoid factor in the blood, the more severe is the
rheumatoid arthritis and the poorer the prognosis. The RA factor level may decrease when
joints are less inflammed.

Most people have mild anaemia i.e. an insufficient number of red blood cells.

When a person with rheumatoid arthritis has a low white blood cell count and an
enlarged spleen, the disorder is called fetty's syndrome.

Prognosis and Treatment :

Regular rest periods often help relieve pain.

Sometime a short period of bedrest helps relieve a severe flare up in its most active
painful stage.
