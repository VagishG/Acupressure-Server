Dupuytren's contracture is a progressive thickening and shortening of the connective
tissue situated beneath the skin of the palm of the hand, causing the ring finger and little
finger to bend permanently towards the palm of the knuckles. It eventually can result in a
claw like hand.

It is a common hereditary disorder that occurs particularly in men and especially after
age of 45.

Itis more common in people with diabetes, alcoholism or epilepsy.

This can be associated with thickening of the fibrous tissue above the knuckles (Garrod's
pads), shrinking of fascia inside the penis that leads to painful emotions (penile fibromatosis)
and nodules on the soles of the feet (plantar fibromatosis).

Main Symptoms ea Mar :
e â€” The first symptom is usually a tender nodule in the palm, most often at the third
and fourth finger.

e The nodule may initially cause discomfort but gradually becomes painless.
e Gradually, the fingers begin to curl.

Eventually the curling worsens and the hand can become arched (clawlike).
