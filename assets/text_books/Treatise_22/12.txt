In allopathy, the main categories of drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis are
Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS), slow acting drugs, corticosteroids and
inmunosuppressive drugs and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors.

Exercises :
Inflammed joints should be exercised gently so that they do not freeze in one position.
As the inflammation subsides, regular active exercises can help.

Treatment of tight joints consists of intensive exercises and occasionally the use of
splints to gradually extend the joint.

Specially modified orthopedic or athletic shoes can make walking less painful.

Devices such as grippers reduce the need to squeeze the hand forcefully.

Food Habits :

Rheumatoid arthritis is a degenerative disease which is becoming more common

these years. This is due to our changed food habits. These days our foods are packed
containing preservatives, colours and flavours etc.

Nutrition plays an important role in arthritis.

Basic improvement in arthritis can be achieved by reverting to natural foods, such as
fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, nuts and other natural foods.
