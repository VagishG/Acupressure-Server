Gangion is a harmless cyst or outpouching of the joint lining under the skin usually on
the back or in front of the wrist, but in some cases on top of the foot.

It looks odd and some people worry that it could be cancerous tumour. However, a
ganglion is simply, a cyst filled with a thick fluid that has escapped the tendons or joints that
the fluid usually lubricates.

It may feel rubbery or hard to touch and may and may not be painful.

Treatment: Tone five or points just around the rim of the ganglion.
