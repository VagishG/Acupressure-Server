Gamekeeper's Thumb
aga & ays & ferme St eet

Gamekeeper's thumb is a rupture of the ligament on the palm side of the thumb, which
is responsible for pinching movement.

It usually results from a fall that jams the thumb backward onto a hard surface.

The injury is so named because it used to be an occupational hazard of gamekeepers
in England, who broke the necks of rabbits with their hands.

Treatment usually consists of a splint, but surgery is sometimes necessary.
