Bursitis in the Heel
Wi at yaa Wt aT ee

Normally only one bursa (asaqet) is found in the heel, between the achilles tendon
and the heel bone.

This bursa may become inflammed, swollen and painful, resulting in anterior achilles
tendon bursitis.

Abnormal pressure and foot dysfunction can cause a protective bursa to form between
the achilles tendon and the skin. This bursa may also become inflammed, swollen and
painful, resulting in posterior achilles tendon bursitis.

To alleviate the stress and pain on the fascia, the person can take shorter steps and
avoid walking barefoot, jogging should be avoided. The person may need to lose weight
stretching the calf muscles often accelerates healing. Orthotics placed into well fitting
supportive shoes can help to cushion, elevate and support the heel. Arch supporting wraps
and ice massage may help.
