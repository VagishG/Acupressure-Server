In achilles tendonitis, the tendon at the base of the heel becomes very tendor and
painful.

Achilles tendonitis is inflammation of the achilles tendon. Achilles tendon is a tough
band extending from the calf muscles to the heel.

The calf muscles and Achilles tendon lower the forefoot after the heel touches the
ground and raise the heel as the toes push off just before stepping to the other foot.

Achilles tendonitis occurs when stresses placed on the tendon are greater than the
tendon's strength.

Running down hill places extra stress on the achilles tendon.

Running up hill also stresses this tendons main symptoms.

The achilles tendon is enclosed in a protective sheath. When the tendon is injured,
scar form between it and its sheath, causing the tendon to pull on the sheath with each
movement.

Main Symptoms Wea mart :

Pain is usually most severe when a person starts to move.

Pain is often relieved by continuing to walk, because it incase the temperature of the
sheath, making it more pliable, so that the tendon can move more freely.

Refraining from running and from pedalling a bicycle as long as the pain persists is an
important part of treatment.
