Morton's Neuroma or Moton's Neuralgia

Morton's Neuroma or Morton's neuralgia waa 4 ad at tio aT :

Morton's neuroma is a noncancerous tumour. It may be caued by the rubbing together
of two metatarsal bones of foot. The metatarsal bonesmake up the central arch of foot.
Severe pain, burning cramping and numbness between the toes and the balls of the feet.

Morton's neuroma is an iritation of the third digital nerve of foot caused by two metatarsal
bones, (that make up the central arch of foot) rubbing together.
The patient feels as if he is walking on pebble or nail.

The nerves that supply the bottom of foot and toes travel between the bones of the
toes. Pain in the ball of the foot may be caused by the noncancerous growths of tissues
between the third and fourth toes. These growths may occur between any of the toes.

Neuromas usually develop in only one foot and are more common in women than in
men.

Roomier shoes and pads relieve pressure on neuroma. Although surgery is succesful,
the nerve tissue may grow back and form another neuroma.

Acupressure treatment is very effective.
