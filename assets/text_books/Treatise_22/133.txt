Morton's toe or toe joint pain or hammer toe or corn on toes :

In hammer toe, the second, third or fourth toe becomes bent and can not be
straightened.

Hammer toe is a deformity in which the bones of one or more of the smaller toes curl
downward into a clawlike position. The second toes is most often affected and is often has
acorn on it. This disorder is caused by ill fitting shoes.

Hammer toes becomes difficult to treat if the toes stiffen.

Pain involving the joints of the four smaller toes is a very common problem. This is
usually caused by misalignment of the joints. This misalignment may result from high or
low arched feet that causes the toes to stay in a bent position. This is called hammer toe.
Constant friction against the bent toes causes the skin over the joint to thicken, resulting in
acorn.

Roomier shoes and pads may relieve pressure on toes.
