Ingrown Toe Nails

Ingrown toe nails usually occur from cutting the nails improperly. If the nails are cut
straight across, the skin presses against he nail of the toe. Irritation, pain and infection may
result.

Ingrown toe nails are nails that grow into the surrounding skin, sometimes causing
infection and disabling pain.

Wearing shoes that are too tight or too narrow can lead to this condition.

Other causes include injuries, fungal infections, abnomalities in foot structure or
repeated pressure and pounding of the feet while exercising.

Do not cut your nails in a curve or do not cut them too short.

To ease the pain of an ingrown toe nails apply warm compresses or soak the foot in
warm water to ease the swelling and pain.

Elevating the foot can help ease the swelling and pain.

Soaking also softens nails to help insert a small piece of cotton between the edges of
the nails and the skin. This helps decrease the discomfort and permits the nail to grow out
without pressed on adjacent flesh.
