Ashin splint is pain resulting from damage to the muscles along the shin.
Following two groups of muscles in the shin are susceptible to shin aplints.
1) Anterolateral shin aplints :
Muscles in the front (anterior) and outsinde (lateral) parts of the shin are affected.

There is pain along the front and outside of the shin. At first, the pain is felt only
immediately after the heel strikes the ground during running, walking, sking etc.

If the person continues to run, the pain occurs through out each step,
eventually becoming constant.

The runner must stop running or do other kinds of exercise.
Exercises to stretch the calf muscles are helpful.
Treatment: St 36, 41, GB 34, 39 Vall

2) Posteromedial shin splints :

In this the muscles of the back (posterior) and inner (medial) parts of the shin
are affected.

The pain produced by this type of shin splint usually starts along the inside of the
lower leg about 1 to 8 inches above the ankle.

The pain worsen, when a runner rises up on the toes or rolls the ankle in.

If the person continues to run, the pain moves forward, affecting the inner aspect
of the ankle and may extend up to the shin to with in 2 to 4 inches of the knee.

The severety of the pain increases as the shin splint progresses.

At first, only the muscle tendons are inflammed and painful. If the person keeps
running, the muscles themselves can be affected.

The primary treatment is to stop running and do other types of exercise until
running is no longer painful.
