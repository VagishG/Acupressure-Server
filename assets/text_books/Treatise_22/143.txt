i) Bucket Handle Exercise :
Wrap a towel around the handle of an empty water bucket.
Sit on a table or other surface high enough to prevent the feet from touching the floor.
Place the bucket handle over the front part of one shoe.

Slowly raise the front part of the foot by flexing the ankle, then slowly extend the foot by
Pointing the toe.

Repeat 10 times, then rest for a few seconds.
Do two more sets of 10.

To increase resistance, add some water to the bucket - but not so much that the
exercise is painful.

Stand up.
Slowly rise up on the toes; then slowly lower the heels to the floor.
Repeat ten times, then rest for 1 minute.
Do two more sets of 10.
