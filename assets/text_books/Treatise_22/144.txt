Flat feet are feet that have little or no arch between the heel and toes, resulting in a sole
that rests flat on the ground.

Everyone has flat feet at birth. The arches do not develop fully until about age 6, after
the ligaments and muscles in the soles are completely formed.

Some people never develop arches in their feet. Other have flatten feet over time as
the ligaments that support the arches loosen or stretch. It happens so due to weight gain.

Many people with fallen arches have no symptoms. Others feel fatigue, pain or stiffness
in the feet, legs and lower back.

Arch support in the shoes help painful fallen arches. Exercise can help strengthen
ligaments and muscles that have become weak.
