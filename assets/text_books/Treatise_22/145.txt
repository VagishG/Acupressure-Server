Sprain in the Foot

Foot sprains usually occur on the metatarsals, the bones that make up the middle of
the foot.

Pounding the foot against the ground or falling may cause foot sprain.

Symptoms include swelling and bruising around the sprained areas, accompanied by
severe pain and loss of function. Putting pressure on the foot or moving it makes pain
worse.

Apply RICE therapy and do not put weight on the foot.

R means rest. It is vital to the recovery of the injured tissue. Do not use the effected
area for several days.

| mean ice. Ice the affected area during the first 24 hours after the sprain. It helps
reduce inflammation and pain. Apply the ice constantly or in intervals for 24 hours.

C means compression.Compression of the sprained area with an elastic bandage
helps reduce swelling, but do not wrap the bandage too tightly.

E means elevation. Elevation of the sprained joint for the first 24 hours, including during
sleep, helps drain fluid and reduce swelling.
