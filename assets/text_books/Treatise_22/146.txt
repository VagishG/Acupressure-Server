Foot Ulcer

Foot ulcers are open sores on the surface of the foot.

Foot ulcers can be caused by poor circulation. People with diabetes are more prone to
foot ulcers, when there is insufficient arterial blood to the foot, tissues are starved for nutrition.
When there is impaired return of blood in the leg veins to the heart, tissues of the foot can
break down causing foot ulcers.

Foot ulcers can also be caused by nerve damage. Foot ulcer may or may not be
painful. If the ulcer is infected, it will produce pus. An infected foot ulcer can lead to gangrene.

Support stocking may be used to aid in circulation. Keeping the feet elevated above
the heart reduces swelling and helps drain the ulcer.
