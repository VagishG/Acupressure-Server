Paronychia
ford aiqet & ant sit & feat & saat er vite, oftra ve

Paronychia is infection of the skin near a finger nail or toe nail.
It is caused by staphylococus and pseudomonas bacteria or by fungi.

Most bacteria and fungi have an affinity for sites that are chronically moist and where
the skin is broken.

Paronychia occurs most in people whose hands are in water frequently.

It can develop suddenly or slowly.

Main Symptoms :

Red, swollen and painful cuticles

The cuticle sometimes rises above the base of the nail and pus forms underneath.
In some people, a very painful pus filled sore occurs.

In chronic infection, more than one nail is affected and the nail becomes deformed and
discoloured.

To prevent the paronychia, keep your hands and feet dry and clean.
Wear rubber gloves when your hands be in water.

Do not cut or push back your cuticles, they provide a barrie against infection invading
the nail.
