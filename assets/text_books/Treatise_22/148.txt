Bunions and Hallux Valgus

Bunions are characterised by hard, fluid filled sacs that forms on the outside of the big
toe due to irritation. The toe may also be deformed.

When the bunion rubs against the shoe, the skin may redden and the underlying bursa
swells and becomes painfully inflammed. The inflammation of the bursa may cause one to
limp.

Women develop bunions about ten times more than men. This is due to wearing the
shoes that are narrow, pointed and high heeled. Pressure from the shoe causes the deformity
of the toe joint.

The bunion increases with age. Soft leather shoes that are wide enough, have low
heels and lace can reduce pressure and pain.
Hallux Valgus :

It is an abnormally positioned big toe in which the joint at the base of the toe bulges
outward from the inner side of the foot and the big toe points toward the smaller toes.

Bunion:

A bunion is a painful swelling of the fluid filled sac at the base of the big toe that occur
because of the hallux valgus.
