Baker's Cyst are tiny sacs filled with synovial fluid that form in an extension of the
capsule behind the knee. These are also called popliteal cysts.

A bakers cyst results from an accumulation of synovial fluid, which bulges from the
joint capsule behind the knee as a protruding sac.

Causes of the joint fluid accumulation may be one of the following :
Rheumatoid arthrites

Osteoarthrites

Backers Cyst produces discomfort at the back of the knee.

The cysts may enlarge and extend downward into the calf muscles.

A rapid increase in the amount and pressure of fluid within the cyst can cause it to
tupture. The fluid released from the cyst can cause the surrounding tissue to become
inflamed, resulting in symptoms that may mimic those of thrombophlebites.

Moreover a bulging or ruptured baker's cyst can cause thrombophlebites in the popliteal
vein by pressing out the vein.
