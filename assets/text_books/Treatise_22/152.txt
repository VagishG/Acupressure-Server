Mallet finger is a deformity in which the fingertip is curved in and can not straighten
iteself.

This deformity usually results from injury, which either damages the tendon or tears
the tendon from the bone.

It can affect one or more finger.

An X-ray is usually taken to be sure that there is no fracture.

The usual treatment is placing a splint on the finger with the finger straightened.
The tendon may take 6 to 8 months to heal.

Mallet finger does not require surgery, unless a large fragment of bone has broken off
or the joint is particularly dislocated, even in the split.
