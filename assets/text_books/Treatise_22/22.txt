Sprain a4

A sprain is a stretched or torn ligament, tendon or muscles.

The tough elastic tissue cords that connects bones to one another is called ligament.

Tendons are tough bands of connective tissue made up of a tough protein called
collagen. They do not stretch. Tendons firmly attach each end of a muscle to a bone. The
tendons are located within sheaths, which are lubricated to allow the tendons to move
without disturbing surrounding tissue.

There are three types of muscles :

i) Skeletal muscles

ji) Smooth muscles

iii) Cardiac muscles (Heart muscles)

Skeletal and smooth muscles are part of the musculoskeletal system.

Skeletal muscles can be contracted to move the various parts of the body.They are
also called striped or striated muscles. They are responsible for posture and movement.
They are attached to bones and are arranged in opposing groups around joints. For example
bicep muscles bend the elbow and tricep muscles straighten the elbow. Skeleton muscles
are controlled by the brain and are called voluntary muscles.

Smooth muscles surround many arteries and contracts to adjust blood flow.
Smooth muscles surround the intestines and contract to move food and feces along the
digestive tract. Smooth muscles are controlled by the brain. They are also called involuntary
muscles.

Cardiac muscle contracts and relaxes rhythmically without a person's awareness.

Bursas are small fluid filled sacs that lie under a tendon, cushioning the tendon and
protecting it from injury. Bursas also provide extra cushioning to adjacent structures that
might rub against each other, causing wear and tear - for example, between a bone and a
ligament.

Pain, tenderness, redness, bruising, swelling or loss of mobility of the sprained part.
