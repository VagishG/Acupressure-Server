Treatment :

RICE is very effective in the treatment of sprain. RICE means rest, ice, compression
and elevation.

Rest is vital to the recovery of injured tissue. Do not use the sprained area for several
days.

Ice the sprained joint during the first 24 hours after the injury. It helps reduce inflamation
and pain. Apply the ice constantly or in intervals for 24 hours.

Compression of sprained area with an elastic bandage helps reduce swelling. Do not
wrap the bandage too tightly.

Elevation of the sprained joint for the first 24 hours, including during sleep, helps drain
fluid and reduce swelling.
