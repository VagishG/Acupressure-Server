Muscle Cramps

Acramp is a sudden, brief, usually painful contraction of a muscle or group of muscles.

Who are affected by Cramps ?

e Cramps are common among healthy people, especially during or after vigorous
exercise.

e Middle aged and older people commonly have cramps, after light exercise or
during rest.

e Some people have cramps during sleep.

e These painful cramps usually affects the calf and foot muscles, causing the foot
and toes to curl downward.

Causes of Cramps:

e Cramps may be caused by inadequate blood flow to the muscles.

 Cramp’s may occur after eating, when blood flows primarily to the digestive tract
rather than to the muscles.

e Low blood level of electrolytes, such as potassium can also cause cramps. Low
potassium level may result from the use of some diuretics or from dehydration.

Prevention :

e Cramps can usually be prevented by not exercising immidiately after eating.

e Cramps can be prevented by generally stretching the muscles before exercising
or going to bed. Stretching makes the muscles and tendons more flexible and
less likely to contract spontaneously.

e —Notconsuming caffeine (coffee or chocolate) and not smoking also helps to prevent
cramps.

e Donot use stimulate drugs to prevent cramps.

e Drinking plenty of fluids (particularly beverages that contain potassium) after
exercise helps to prevent cramps.

Acupressure Treatment of Cramps :

1) Treatment during the attack of cramp :

During the attack of a cramp, the energy is excess at the location of the cramp
due to stasis of blood, or any other type of stagnation. Hence, the treatment is to
be given by a sedation.
