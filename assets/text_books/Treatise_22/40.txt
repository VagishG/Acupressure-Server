points radiate the pain to a distant site).

During flare ups, muscle tightness or even spasms may occur.

Soft tissues of the neck, shoulders, chest and rib cage, lower back and thighs as
well as joints are likely to be painful.

In primary fibromyalgia syndrome, widespread pain occurs with other symptoms
such as poor sleep, anxiety, depression, fatigue and irritable bowel syndrome.
