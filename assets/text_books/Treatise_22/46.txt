Paget's disease of bone is a chronic disorder of the skeleton in which areas of bone
undergo abnormal turnover, resulting in areas of enlarged and softened bone.

Paget's disease can affect anybone, but the most commonly affected bones are :
The pelvis bone

The thigh bone (Femur)

The skin bone (Tibita)

The skull bone

The spine bone (vertebrae)

The collar bone (Clavicle)

The upper arm bone (Humerus)

e Paget's disease rarely occurs in people younger than 40. 1% people older than
40 have this order.

e Normally, cells that break down old bone (osteoclasts) and cells that form new
bones (osteoblast) work in balance to maintain bone structure and integrity.

e _ Inpage't's disease, both osteoclasts and osteoblasts become overactive in some
areas of the bone. In these areas the bone increases tremendously.

e The overactive areas enlarge but are structurally weaker than normal areas.
e The paget's disease tends to run in families.

Main Symptoms Wea wert :

e Bone pain, bone enlargement or bone deformity may occur.

e Bone pain may be deep, aching and occasionally severe and may worsen at
night.
