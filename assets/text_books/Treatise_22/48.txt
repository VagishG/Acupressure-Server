The enlarged bones may compress nerves adding to the pain.

Sometimes, the Paget's disease distorts the adjacert joint structure and leads to
the development of painful osteoarthritis.

Stiff joints and fatigue may develop slowly and subtly.
Symptoms vary, depending on which bones are affected.

The Skull may enlarge and the brow and forehead may look more prominent.
Enlarged. Skull bones can cause hearing loss, dizziness and headaches.
The vertabrae may enlarge, weaken and buckle, resulting in a loss of height.
Damaged vertebrae may pinch the nerves of the spinal cord, causing pain,
numbness, tingling, weakness or even paralysis in the legs.

People whose hip or leg bones are affected may have bowed legs, take
short and unsteady steps. Affected bones are more likely to break.

High blood levels of calcium occasionally occur in bedridden older people
with Paget's disease. These high levels of calcium can result in many
symptoms such as high blood pressure, muscle weakness, mild bowel
disturbances and stones in the urine.

If one leg becomes bowed, heel lifts can help make walking easier.

Bed rest (except for sleeping at night) should be avoided to prevent
hypercalcemia.

Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D (necessary for calcium intake) should
be sufficient to ensure that the incorporation of calcium into the bone is
adequate, otherwise poor osteomalacia may occur.

Prognosis :

The prognosis of people with Paget's disease on Acupressure treatment is most often
very good.

Few people who develop bone cancer (osteosarcoma), fibrosacroma or
chondrosacroma have a poor prognosis.

Treatment :
Kidney essence deficiency causes K3,6, CV 4, GV 4, 14, 20, UB 11, 15, 23,
