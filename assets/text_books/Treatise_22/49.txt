Runner's Knee agt are & yet

Runner's knee is a condition in which the knee cap (Patella) rubs roughly against the
end of the thighbone (Femur) when the knee moves.

The knee cap is a circular bone that is attached to ligaments and tendons around the

knee.

The knee cap normally moves up or down, slightly without touching the thighbone
during running.
Runner's knee may be caused by a structural defect, such as :

i)

ii)
ii)
iv)
v)

Aknee cap located too high or too low in the knee joint.

Off centre insertion of the muscles into the knee cap.

Tight harmstrings.

Tight achilles tendons.

Aweak thigh muscles - which normally help stabilize the knee.

Weak thigh muscles are the most common treatable cause of runner's knee.
These weak muscles allow the knee cap to move sideways and rub against the
thigh bone.

Asecond common treatable cause is rolling of the feet onto the outside (pronation)
excessively when walking or running while the front thigh muscles (quadriceps)
pull the knee cap outward.

Together, these forces cause the knee cap to rub against the end of the thighbone.
Pain and sometimes swelling usually start during running on the undersurface of
knee cap. At first, only running downhill is painful. Later on, any running and
eventually walking downsteps are painful.

Stop running until it can be done without pain is important

Riding a bicycle, racing and swimming can be continued to maintain physical
fitness.

Exercises to stretch the muscles in the back (harmstrings) and front (quadriceps)
of the thigh and to strengthen the vastus medialis, an inner thigh muscles that
pulls the knee cap inward are helpful.

Arch supports in shoes may help.
