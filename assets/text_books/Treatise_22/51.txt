Popliteous Tendonitis
Wawa daw

Popliteous tendonitis is inflammation in the popliteous tendon which extends from the
outer surface of the bottom of the thighbone (Femur) diagnally across the back of the knee
to the inner side of the top of the shinbone (Tibia)

The popliteous tendon prevents the lower leg from twisting outward during running.

Excessive rolling of the feet on to the outside (Pronation) as well as running downhill,
tends to put excessive stress on this tendon, which can tear it.

Pain and soreness, particularly when running downhill, develop along the outside of
the knee.

A person should not run until the area is free of pain and should not run downhill for
atleast 3 weeks after resuming running.

Bicycling is a good alternative exercise during healing.

Shoe inserts especially a triangular wedge (Varus wedge) placed infront of the heel
can help heep the foot from rolling inward.
