Scleroderma means hard skin.

This autoimmune disease causes hardness and stiffness of the skin due to
overproduction of collegen. Collagen is a protein that in normal amounts gives skin strength
and elasticity.

In some people, damage to internal organs also occurs when skin involvement is
widespread as a result of the overproduction of collagen, the disease is called systemic
sclerosis or diffuse scleroderma.

Scleroderma affects about 1 in 2,000 people. Women are affected three times more
than men.

Main Symptoms :

There are two main types of Scleroderma :

i) Limited Scleroderma

ii) Diffuse Scleroderma

i) Limited Scleroderma :
It causes skin to become shiny and uncomfortably tight on the face and fingers.
Sweat glands and hair follicles are greatly diminished in the affected areas, so
the skin is dry and hairless.
Limited Scleroderma sometimes improves on its own.
It is almost always accompanied by Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's
phenomenon is a painful condition, in which the flow of blood to the hands and
feet is constricted, making them abnormally senstive to heat and cold.

ii) Diffuse Scleroderma :
It is the more serious form affecting one or more major organs such as the
arteries, kidneys and lungs as well as the skin. Raynaud's phenomenon is always
present.
