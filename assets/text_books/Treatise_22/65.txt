Stiff Person's Syndromes
cafe & arate west dere

In stiff person's syndromes the muscles of the trunk, abdomen and legs gradually
become stiffer.

The muscles of the arms, head and neck are affected to a lesser degree.
The affected muscles enlarge.
Stiff person's syndrome is more common among women.

It may be due to an autoimmune reaction. In stiff person's syndromes the nerves
repeatedly send electrical signals to muscles, resulting in overstimulation. The overactivity
is thought to be a factor in stiff person's syndrome.

The treatment should be directed towards consistantly relieving the muscles stiffness.
Without treatment, the disorder progresses, leading to disability and stiffness throughout
the body.

Acupressure Treatment: For stiffness in head, neck, jaw, throat etc.
