Bruising and Abrasions
ala Wg &

Bruising is a dark discolouration of skin occurring after an injury.

Sharp bump or blow tears small blood vessels in deepest layer of the skin and allows
blood to leak out and collect in the thin top layer of the skin and between cells and fibres in
the dermis. (deepest layer of skin)

The body responds quickly, to contain the bleeding. The platelets form a semi solid
plug that prevents more blood from escaping.

Within a few days, the bruise takes on a yellowish hue, as the escaped red blood cells
are beroken down by white blood cells.

If the bruise does not fade within a weak, this can be a sign of anunderlying bleeding
disorder.
