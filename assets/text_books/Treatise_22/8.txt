Diagnosis :

Blood tests showing high levels of antibodies to streptococci may be helpful in the
diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

Abnormal heart rhythms caused by heart inflammation can be seen on an E. C.G.

AnE. C. G. may be used to diagnose abnormalitis of the heart valves.

Prevention and Treatment :

The best way to prevent rheumatic fever is with prompt and complete antibiotic treatment
of any streptococcal throat infection.

Children who have had rheumatic fever should be given pencillin by mouth everyday or
by monthly injectious into the muscle, to help prevent another streptococcal infection.

This preventive treatment should be continued until adulthood, and some doctors feel
that it should be continued for life.

Treatment of rheumatic fever has three goals :

i) Curing any residual streptococcal infection

ii) | Reducing inflammation, particularly in the joints and heart.

iii) Limiting physical activity that might aggravate the inflammed structures.

Doctors give children with rheumatic fever an injection of long acting penicillin to
eliminate any remaining infection.

Aspirin is given in high doses to reduce inflammation and pain, particularly if the
inflammation has reached the joints and heart.
If heart inflammation is severe, corticosteroids are given to further reduce inflammation.
Bed rests may help by avoiding stress on the painful, inflamed joints.
When the heart is inflammed, more rest is generally suggested.
