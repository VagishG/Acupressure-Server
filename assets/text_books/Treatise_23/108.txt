Diagnosis :

This was a case of full heat in liver. Liver fire has a natural tendency to flare upwards.
It causes red face and eyes, irritability and other symptoms.

The red tongue body indicates the heat. The redder colour of the sides reflects the
location of heat in the liver.

The full rapid pulse reflects full heat. The wiry quality of the pulse indicates the location
of heat in the liver.

The most common cause of this pattern is a long standing emotinoal state of anger,
resentment, repressed anger or frustration. The emotion repression makes Qi stagnate
and implode giving rise to heat.

From a dietary point of view, the excessive consumption of alcohol, fried foods and
meat can contribute to the formation of heat in the liver.
