Uncontrolled lengther or cry, shouting, violent behaviour, hitting or scolding people,
incoherent speech, insanity appear in manic phase, when heart heat is predominant than
phlegm in heart.

Mental depression, dullness, muttering to oneself, propensity to be startled, mental
confusion appear during depression phase, when phlegm in heart is more prominant than
heart heat.

The yellow sticky coating on the tongue reflects the presence of phlegm. The red body
colour of the tongue reflects the presence of heat. The redder and swollen tip of the tongue
with red points indicate heart fire.

One month treatment gave full relief in all the symptoms. The patient was advised to
continue this treatment for atleast a year to avoid recurrence.
