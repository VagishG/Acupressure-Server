Pathology:

This is an interior excess pattern.

Most of the symptoms are caused by obstruction of food in the stomach, preventing
stomach Qi from descending hence the nausea, vomiting, feeling of fullness, belching and
sour regurgitation.

The foul breathe is due to the fermentation of food in the stomach for too long.

The prolonged retention of food in the stomach creates an obstruction in the middle
warmer and prevents heart Qi from descending. This causes the mind to be disturbed at
night resulting in insomnia.
