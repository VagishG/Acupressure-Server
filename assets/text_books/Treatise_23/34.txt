Diagnosis :

The above symptoms indicate interior full heat in the stomach.

Heat in the stomach burns the fluids, hence the intense thirst, constipation and dry

tongue.

The heat makes the blood extravasate in the stomach channel resulting in the bleeding
from the gums.

Full heat obstructs the stomach and hence the stomach Qi can not descent properly.
It causes epigastric burning pain, nausea and vomiting.

Full heat in the stomach can affect the mind and cause insomnia or severe manic
depression. This is often reflected on the tongue with large midline crack not reaching the
tip with yellow stiff coating (prickles) inside it.

This pattern caused due to excessive consumption of hot foods eg., smoking, tobacco
chewing, deep fried food etc.
