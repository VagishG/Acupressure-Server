Diagnosis :

The above symptoms indicate a Liver Qi stagnation manifesting more in throat than
hypochondrium.

The depression, mood swings and premenstrual irritation, with distension of the breasts,
the wiry pulse, the slightly pruple colour on the sides of the tongue, all clearly point to stagnation
of Liver Qi.

Had the periods been painful with dark clotted blood and the tongue been more purple,
the diagnosis would have been stasis of Liver blood.
