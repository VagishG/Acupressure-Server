Diagnosis :

The above symptoms indicate stagnation of Liver Qi attacking the Stomach, Spleen
and Intestines.

In this case the symptoms appear in three organs viz. stomach, spleen and intestines.
All the symptoms are caused by Liver Qi Stagnation.

Epigastric pain, distention, belching and nausea indicates that the stomach has been
attacked.

Diarrhea, abdominal pain and distension indicate that the spleen has been attacked.
Constipation with bitty small stools indicate that the intestines have been attacked.
Wiry pulse and red colour of the sides of the tongue confirms that the liver is involved.
Here the primary factor is stagnation of Liver Qi.

The secondary factors are the attack of Liver on stomach, spleen and intestines.

The red colour of tongue indicates that the stagnation of Liver Qi is beginning to
transform into Liver Fire, as it happens after a prolonged period.
