The pain during and before periods with dark clotted blood and the purple colour of
tongue indicates stasis of Liver blood.

Premenstrual distension of breast indicates some stagnation of Liver Qi.

Choppy pulse, floaters in eyes, and the dizziness indicates Liver blood deficiency.
Bluish purple colour of tongue develops in a pale tongue which is due to Liver blood deficiency.

Chilliness, white vaginal discharge, the swollen tongue, the feeling of heaviness and
bearing down sensation and the dirty sticky tongue coating, these all indicate spleen yang
deficiency causing retention of dampness.

Bluish purple tongue indicates that the stasis of blood is caused by cold due to deficient
spleen yang.
