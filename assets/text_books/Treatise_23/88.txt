external cold has attacked the interior immediately, by passing the skin outers and settling
in the large intestines. The large intestine, stomach and uterus are the three organs which
can be attacked by external cold directly.

Attack of external cold and humidity on the large intestines can take place, if a person
sits on a cold and wet surfaces for prolonged periods. If a person is exposed to very cold

weather having the abdomen insufficiently covered, there can be an acute external attack of
cold on the large intestines.
