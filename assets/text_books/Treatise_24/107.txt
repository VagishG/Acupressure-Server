When the kidney Yin is deficient, it fails to produce enough marrow to fill the brain. It
results in :

e — Gradual tinnitus with slow onset with a sound like rushing water
e Vertigo

e Poor memory

Kidney Yin deficiency leads to lack of body fluids and in turn it causes dryness with

Kidney Yin deficiency leads to empty heat in kidney causing five palm heat, night
sweating, red tongue and rapid pulse.

Night sweating is injurious to health. Night sweating is due to the Yin being deficient
and failing to hold defensive Qi in the body at night. Defensive Qi goes into the Yin at night.
With the night sweat, the precious Yin nutritive essences comes out with the sweat. Hence,
the night sweating causes poor defensive Qi and weakness.
