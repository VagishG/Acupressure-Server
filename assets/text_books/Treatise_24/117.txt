External wind enters the body via the skin.
Itinterferes with the circulation of defensive Qi in the space between skin and muscles.
Since the defensive Qi warms the muscles, the person feels chilly, shivers and has

aversion to cold, when there is an attack of external wind.

Aversion to cold and wind is a characteristic symptom of attack of external wind.
The patient feels cold and shivers and is reluctant to go outside in the cold.

The Lungs also control the opening and closing of the pores.

When the external wind enters the exterior of the body is the space between the skin

and muscles, it jeopardises the Lung's function of descending and dispersing.
