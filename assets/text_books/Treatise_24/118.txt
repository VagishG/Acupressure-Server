This causes sneezing and coughing.

The impairment of the Lung's dispersing and descending function prevents the spreading
and descending of Lungs fluids. It results in a runny nose with profuse white discharge.

There is a fight between the external wind and the defensive Qi of the body in the skin
and the muscles.

External wind attacks the most superficial channels first.

The most superficial channels are the greater Yang channels (small intestine and
urinary bladder channels.

External wind obstructs the circulation of defensive Qi within small intestine and urinary
bladder meridians.

This causes stiffness and pain along small intestine and urinary bladder meridians
and particularly in the back of the neck.

External wind attacks the top part of the body and often obstructs in the throat causing
an itchy sensation in the throat.

If the wind combines with the cold with more cold than wind, these will be no sweating
because the cold contracts the pores. The pulse will be tight.

\f the wind combines with the cold with more wind than cold, the pores are open, there
is slight sweating. The pulse will be slow.

If a person has a strong constitution and a tendency to excess patterns, then the
defensive Qi of the body reacts strongly. The pores will be closed these will be no sweating.
This is called external excess pattern.

Ifa person has a weak constitution and a tendency to deficiency patterns, the defensive
Qi reacts less strongly. The pores are open. There will be a slight sweating. This is called
exterior deficiency pattern.

When the external wind attacks the body, the defensive Qi rushes to the external part
of the body.

This is reflected on the pulse which becomes more superficial (floating pulse)

Main symptoms of attack of external wind :

e — Aversion to cold or wind.

e — Sneering

e Cough
