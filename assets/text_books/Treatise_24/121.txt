Discussion :

Attack of the external wind prevents the Lungs from opening the water passages and
dispersing and lowering fluids.

Fluids can not descend, hence, they overflow under the skin causing edema. This
edema would be more prominent in the face as it is caused by a Lung's dysfunction which
mostly affects the upper warmer.

This facial edema which occurs in the beginning stage of acute nephritis is this external
attack of wind water.
