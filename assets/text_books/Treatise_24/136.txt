Pathology :

i) | The Spleen Qi deficiency causes impairment of transformation and transportation
function producing digestive symptoms such as :
e Abdominal distension
e Loose stools
e Lack of appetite

(ii) Spleen is responsible for transporting food Qi to the four limbs. When the spleen
Qiis deficient, the four limbs are deprived of the nourishment and feel weak. In
the long run the four limbs become thin with muscle wasting.

(iii) Spleen Qi also transports food Qi throughout the body. Hence there is tiredness

and lassitude when the spleen Qi is deficient.

When the Spleen Qi is deficient for a long period the Spleen is unable to transform
fluids and gives rise to dampness which obstructs the chest and epigastrium resulting in
the typical sensation of stiffness.

Dampness is heavy and difficult to get rid of

Dampness accumulates in the muscles causing a feeling of heaviness of head or

limbs.
