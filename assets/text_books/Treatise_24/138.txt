Pathology :

i) Pathology of this pattern is the same as that of Spleen Qi deficiency with the
addition of cold symptoms, such as chilliness and cold limbs. These are due to
the failure of spleen yang to warm the body.

ii) The edema is due to impairment of the spleen function in transforming and
transporting fluids. When fluids can not be transformed they accumulate in the
body either as dampness or under the skin as edema.

iii) The tongue is pale due to deficiency of yang and the tongue is wet and swollen
because of the impairment in the Spleen function of transportation of fluids which
leads to accumulation of fluids on the tongue causing wetness and in the tongue
causing swollen tongue.

iv) The pulse is deep and slow reflecting the deficiency of yang.
