Aetiology:

i) _ Exposure to external dampness in the weather or damp living conditions causes
this pattern.

ii) | Chronic deficiency of Spleen Qi which leads to the formation of dampness may
also cause this pattern.

Pathology :

This is an excess condition.

When the spleen is attacked by external dampness, the above referred symptoms
appear in acute stage.

Dampness obstructs the chest and epigastrium. It prevents the normal movement of
Qi causing a feeling of stiffness and heaviness in chest and epigastrium.

Dampness also prevents the clear yang from the head causing a feeling of heaviness
of the head.

The spleen opens into the mouth and when dampness obstructs the spleen, it affects
the taste.

Dampness is heavy and has a tendency to flow downwards and when it flows dwnwards
it causes vaginal discharge.

The sticky and slippery tongue coating indicates dampness.

The slippery pulse also indicates dampness.

If the tongue is pale with a thin coating, this indicates that this pattern is chronic due to
chronic Spleen Qi deficiency producing dampness.
