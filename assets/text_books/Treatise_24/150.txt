Heat causes bitter taste, fever, dark urine, thirst

There is thirst because of the heat but there is no desire to drink or desires to
drink in small sips due to presence of dampness.

This pattern is often seen in gall bladder stones. In acupressure perspective stones
are an extreme form of dampness in its most substantial state. Stones are formed
over a long period of time from dampness under the breuing action of heat. Thus
stones are always considered a manifestation of damp-heat or phlegm fire.
