There is a direct and precise correlation between the meridians and physical shape of
the body.

Powerful limbs, a broad chest, firm flesh, a dull pink colour of the skin are indicative of
a strong constitution.

Astlight body built, a narrow chest, lean body, a lusterless skin reveal weak constitution.
The width of pores is indicate of the strength of constructive and defensive energies.
The resilience of the flesh in a general way reveals the energy level of the stomach Qi.
The strength of the muscles and sinuses relates to the energies available from the
liver meridian.

The strength and largeness of bones relates to the strength of the kidney meridian.
Astrong body and good appetite indicates strength of the spleen and stomach meridian.
A fat body and reduced appetite indicates phlegm due to deficiency of spleen and
stomach.

A lean body with good appetite indicates heat in spleen and stomach and possibly
also heat in liver and gall bladder.

An extremely emaciated body indicates that yin energies have been spent to the
extreme.

A very large, barrel like chest and epigastrium indicates an excess condition of the
stomach.

Very large upper thighs, out of proportion with the rest of the body, which might even
be thin, indicates spleen deficiency.

A thin and emaciated body indicates a long standing deficiency of blood or yin.

A fat body usually indicates deficiency of spleen yang with tendency to retention of
dampness or phlegm.

A weakness or stiffness of sinews (muscles and tendons) indicates a problem of the
liver.
