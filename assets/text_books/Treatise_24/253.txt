1) If the patient feels sudden attack of chilliness and he has aversion to cold, it
indicates an external attack of wind. If may be external attack of wind cold or wind
heat. In both these cases there is aversion to cold. In the external attack of wind,
the pathogenic factor blocks the circulation of defensive Qi, which can not worm
the body and hence the patient feels cold covering the body up does not alleviate
the chilliness.

In the external attack of wind cold fever may be present simultancously with the
aversion to cold.

In the external attack of wind heat fever is there along with slight aversion to cold.

2) Fever includes actual fever and a feeling of heat rather than actual fever. A person

may have pronounced feeling of heat without an actual fever, conversely, one
may have actual temperature but have no feeling of heat.
