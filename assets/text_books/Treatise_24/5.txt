Causes of disease :

i) There is accumulation of the indigested food in the stomach. This is either due
to over eating or due to stomach Qi deficiency being unable to make food
descend.

ii) The accumulation of food in the stomach causes dull pain & fullness. This
causes belching, sour regurgitations, nausea & vomiting.

iii) Vomiting relieves the epigastric pain. It indicates that the obstruction in stom-
ach is of substantial nature. Substantial means actual accumulation of
undigested food.

The therapists should know that stagnation of Qi also causes obstruction which
is nonsubstantial. This is why the pain is not relieved by vomiting.

iv) | There may be constipation or loose stools depending upon the relative strength
of stomach and spleen.
If the spleen is deficient, it causes loose stools.
If the spleen Qi is excess, it causes constipation.
v) The slippery pulse indicates the retention of undigested food in the stomach.
Treatment Principles :
i) Clear the stagnation
ii) Move the accumulations
iii) Restore descending of stomach Qi
