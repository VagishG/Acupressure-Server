11) Sleep Apnea Syndromes wha eftran sera =

Sleep apnea syndromes are a group of serious sleep disorders in which breathing
repeatedly stops long enough during sleep to decrease the amount of Oxygen
and increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and brain.

Sleep apnea occurs when breathing is temporarily interrupted during sleep.

Sleep apnea may be due to blockage in the throat or upper airway. This is called
obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea may also be caused by dysfunction in the
brain stem which controls breathing.
