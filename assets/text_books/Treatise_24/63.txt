Children Diagnosis seat #1 t fret

Interrogation of children does not differ substantially from that of adults, except that it
needs to be carried out mostly with the child's parents.
There are several questions, however, which are peculiar to children's problems.
First of all, one needs to ask about the pregnancy as emotional shocks or physical
traumas can affect the constitution of the baby. Also the consumption of alcohol, smoking
and use of drugs (of the medicinal or “recreational” kind) all affect the health of the baby
adversely.
i) Traumas at birth, such as Caesarian or very long birth will affect the baby,
particularly the baby's Lungs.
i) | One also needs to ask about breast-feeding and weaning. Weaning too early can
lead to the retention of food and some skin diseases.
iii) It is also important to ask about vaccinations as, in some cases, these may
cause problems.
iv) Finally, in older children, one must ask about childhood diseases such as whooping
cough or measles.
v) Whooping cough usually leaves the Lungs quite weakened especially if it occurs
in a severe form.
vi) Persistent sore throats and/or a runny nose in children often indicates too early
weaning or too rich food consumed too early.
