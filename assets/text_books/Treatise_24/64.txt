Pulse Diagnosis 76 fret

Method for taking the pulse :

Time :

Traditionally, the best time for taking the pulse is in the early morning when the Yin is
calm and the Yang has not yet come forth.

This is of course not always possible to achieve when patients are seen throughout
the day.

Levelling the arm :

The patient's arm should be horizontal and should not be held higher than the level of

the heart.

Placing the fingers :

The practitioner's finaers are all placed on the pules=!SS" lich is felt with the first three
fingers. To assess individual positions, it may be necessary to lift two of these fingers
slightly but, generally, it is better to keep all the fingers in place to get a better idea of Qiand
Blood in general.

Equalizing the breathing :

It is traditionally important for the practitioner to regulate and balance his or her own
breathing pattern in order to be better attuned to the patient's Qi better and to become more
receptive.

Another reason for doing this was that the patient's pulse was correlated with the
practitioner's breathing cycles in order to determine whether it is slow or rapid.

Factors to take into account :

Several factors should be taken into account in order to evaluate each pulse in its
context and in relation to an individual patient.

Seasons:

These influence the pulse, it being deeper in winter time and more superficial in
summer time.

Sex:

Men's pulses are naturally slightly stronger than women's. Also, in men the left
pulse should be very slightly stronger, and in women the right pulse should be slightly
stronger.
