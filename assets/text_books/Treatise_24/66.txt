When interpreting the pulse one should therefore pay attention to the following elements
and in this order :

Feel whether the pulse has spirit, Stomach Qi and root
Feel the three levels and the three positions

Feel the strength of the pulse

Feel the quality of the pulse

There are 28 pulse qualities, as follows :

2)

Floating (or Superficial) Pulse :

Feeling:

This pulse can be felt with a light pressure of the fingers, just resting the fingers
on the artery.

Clinical significance :

This quality indicates the presence of an extemal pattern from attack by an external
pathogenic factor, such as Wind-Cold or wind Heat. If it is floating and tight it
indicates Wind-Cold; if it is floating and rapid it indicaes Wind-Heat.

If the pulse is floating at the superficial level but empty at the deep level, it indicates
deficiency of Yin.

In rare cases, the pulse can be floating in Interior conditions, such as anaemia or
cancer. In these cases, the pulse is floating because Qi is very deficiency and
“floats” to the surface of the body.

Deep Pulse :
Feeling:

This pulse is the opposite to the preceding one : it can only be felt with a heavy
pressure of the fingers and is felt near the bone.
