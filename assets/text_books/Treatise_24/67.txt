Feeling:
This pulse has three beats per respiration cycle (of the practitioner). In the old
times the rate was referred to the practitioner's respiration cycle, but nowadays
the pulse rate can also be counted conventionally using a watch.

Normal rates vary but they are roughly :

Age (Year) Rate (Beat/Min)
1-4 90 or more
4-10 84
10-16 78/80
16-35 76
35-50 72/70
50+ 68
