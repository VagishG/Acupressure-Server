If the abdomen feels full on touch and no pain is elicited on pressure it indicates
an Empty pattern.

If pain is elicited, it indicates a full pattern.

The elasticity and strength of the abdomen is important; it should feel solid but not
hard, resilient but not tight, elastic but not soft.

If it feels like this it indicates the good state of the original Qi.
If it feels too soft and flabby, it indicates deficiency of Original Qi.

The relative tightness or softness of the upper and lower part of the abdomen is
significant.

The upper part of the abdomen just below the xyphoid process reflects the state of the
Upper Burner Qi, i.e. Lung and Heart Qi and Gathering Qi. This area should be relatively
softer than the rest, indicating a smooth flow of Lung and Heart Qi.

If it feels hard and knotted, it indicates a constraint of Lung and Heart Qi and a
constriction of the Corporeal Soul due to emotional tension.

The lower part of the abdomen below the umbilicus should fee relatively tenser (but
elastic) than the rest, indicating a good state of the original Qi of the Kidneys.

If it feels soft and flabby, it indicates a weakness of the original Qi.

Abdominal masses that move under the fingers indicate stagnation of Qi; if they do not
move and feel very hard, they indicates stasis of blood.
