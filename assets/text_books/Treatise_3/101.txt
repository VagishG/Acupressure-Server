G_ Rheumatic Arthritis :
Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune disease occuring two to four weeks after
throat infections. Children and young adults are most commonly affected.

After the acute phase, there may be permanent damage to the heart valves,
eventually it may lead to disability and possibly cardiac failure, stenosis and
incompetence of Mitral and Aortic valves takes place. Tricuspid valve is sometimes
affected and the pulmonary valve is rarely affected.

The pericardium may become inelastic. The function of expansion of heart may
be reduced. It leads to reduced cardiac output.

Both rheumatic fever and its after effects as rheumatic arthritis, heart valves
stenosis, and inelasticity of pericardium can be treated via the Allergy and Vascular
Degeneration Meridian.
