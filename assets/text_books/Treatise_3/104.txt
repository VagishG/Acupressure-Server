Special Notes :

To treat arterial sclerosis, first treat allergy.

Initial damage to internal lining of blood vessels is called arterial sclerosis.

To know the amount of blockage in arteries and for the cure of the same, treat this
point.

Arterial sclerosis is a progressive degenerative condition of the walls of arteries.
Itis associated with aging and is accompanied by hypertension. Loss of elasticity
increases systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Pulse pressure is the
difference between systolic and diastolic pressure. In small arteries, the narrowing
of the lumen increases peripheral resistances and blood pressure. Ischaemia of
tissues supplied by affected arteries may occur. It may cause gangarene which
is serious in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Senile arterial sclerosis affects elderly people. There is progressive loss of elasticity
and reduced arterial lumen. It causes cerebral ischaemia and loss of mental
function. There may be hypertension also.
