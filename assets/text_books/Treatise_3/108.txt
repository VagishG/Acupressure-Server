Whatis Epithelial Degeneration?

In the hollow organs viz., blood vessels, G.I.T., heart, urinary bladder, uterus,
vagina, ureter, urethra etc., the luminal surface is again protected by single or
more layer of cells.

This deep layer is known as epithelium or endothelium. Degeneration of this deep
layer is known as epithelial degeneration.

. Hydropic degeneration of kidney, liver and heart.

Chronic Osteomyelitis

Empyema

Hodkins disease

Multiple Myelomatosis

Tuberculosis

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Atherome (degeneration of blood vessels, mainly arteries)

Less production of erythrocytes and leucocytes. This happes because of
the degeneration of mucoid and lipid in bone marrow.

Stopping of Impulse. Degeneration of lipid in nerves is the reason for this.

Lipoidal degeneration of glomerules in kidney reduces the formation of urine.
In this filtration rate decreases.

Degeneration in tubules of nephrons of kidneys reduces the absorption
capacity of nephron.

In osteoarthritis, degeneration in cartilage of the points of bone reduces the
repairing capacity of cartilages, movement of joints reduces. This disease
mainly appears in cervical, spine, basal joints of thumb and hip joint.
Albuminous degeneration of kidney, liver and heart.

Lipoidal degeneration of gall bladder, heart, kidney, brain and thyroid glands.
