Outer covering of these 9 organs is called Peritoneum. This peritoneum does
two activities :

i) Activity of serous coat of organ.

ii) Activity of keeping the organ in place.

Ifany above stated organ shifts from its original place then treatment on this point
shifts back the organ to its original place. In all these meridians (of organs) have
a Serous Membrane Coating Point reated to their sercus coating and peritoneum.
In the case of ulcer either the serous coat of the organ becomes porous or the
coat itself, thins down or decreases at one point. Treatment on serous membrane
coating point (According to EAV) restores the serous coat and cures ulcer. Proper
treatment of ulcers of stomach, small intestine and large intestine is successfully
possible with the serous membrane point discovered by Dr. Voll. Excess or reduced
serous coat results in peritonitis or adhesion respectively. Organ becomes painful
in both type of cases. Serous membrane coating point and peritoneum point is
the treatment point for both type of cases.

A.1.P. (Autonomic Innervation Point) :

Itis also called Innervation Point or Plexus Point. In every organâ€™s meridian there
is an autonomic innervation point which connects the organ to spinal cord and
receives the nutrition and instructions for the autonomic work from brain through
spinal cord. It is also called as automatic steering point. Treatment on this point
treats autonomic plexus of the related organ and helps in restoring the
