synchronisation between the organ and brain and spinal cord. This point indicates
the fault in the autonomic steering of an organ and this is also a point for the
treatment of same.

Brain is a computerized power station. Spinal Cord is like main transformer. Each
organ's plexus or innervation point is like the transformer of the colony. Like when
the transformer of the colony is weak, the voltage of electricity reduces in the
houses of colony and light becomes dim. In this, if we rectify the transformer of
the colony, it restores the voltage of electricity and results is full light. In the sme
way each organ in our body is also connected with one or more than one plexuses.
If there is any problem in any plexus, the energy supply to the related organ reduces
and instructions from the brain also start, missing. This all results in reduced
working capacity of that organ and the person becomes the patient of that organ's
disease. For example : .

e Cardiac Plexus
e Coronary Plexus
e Cardiac Ganglia

In the case of heart disease, treatment for the functionality of all the three plexuses
results in the enhancement of function and working capacity of Heart. At the time
of surgical operation of any body part, anaesthesia is given on these plexuses to
numb the related organ by these plexuses. There are 48 plexuses in total in our
human body.

L. D. P. (Lymphatic Drainage Point) :

According to E. A. V. every meridian has a lymphatic drainage point. This point
controls the lymphatic secretion of the related organ. Problems related to lymphatic

secretion of that organ is being diagnosed by this point. Every part and all organs
of the body have related lymphatic drainage point.

This discovery helps in curing irritation, swelling, pain, abcess, pock, pus, infection
of any part or any organ of the body easily by giving treatment on lymph drainage

point of that organ.
