GThere is a close relationship between skin and allergy. So, before treating the

skin disease first check the possibility of allergy of the skin. Ifit is an allergy then
whether allergy is the resultant of internal problem of body or it is the affect of
external contacts like soaps, shampoo, lotion, terylene cloth etc. Diagnosis and
treatment should be given on both the meridians skin degeneration vessel and
allergy or vascular degeneration vessel. SK 1-2 is the diagnosis point for all the
