First three phases (Excretion, Reaction and Deposition) are called as ‘liquid’ or “semi
liquid phase means humeral processes”. In this phase there is no change in the chemical
composition of cell.

Last three stages (Impregnation, Degeneration and Malignant) are known as cellular
phase. In the cellular phase change, destruction and deterioration starts in the cell. These,
last three phases, can be diagnosed by chemical tests.

Inthe humeral process when deposition starts at various places in body then sometimes
diagnosis can be done by chemical tests but sometimes chemical tests are not helpful.

By Electro Acupuncture diagnosis of both the processes i.e. humeral process and
cellular process and stage of disease in those six stages is possible. Accordingly treatment
can be given and could prevent from the serious diseases in future.

Q_ Indications of disease are as follows :
1) Inflammatory Symptom
2) Degenerative Symptom

3) Combination of Inflammatory & Degenerative Symptoms. This happens in old
and chronic cases.

4) Acute Focus of Disturbance (Foci)

1) Inflammatory Phase :
Inflammation is a protective tissue response to an injury or destruction of tissues,
which serves to destroy, dilute or wall off both the injurious agent and the injured tissues.
The classical signs of acute inflammation are pain, heat, redness, swelling and loss of
function.
When non-required bacteria or element enters into the cell of a healthy body, then
Lysosomes of the cell eat them up and digest them with their own enzyme. But when
these lysosomes fail to do this job then they get burst out from cell membrane in outer
Cell liquid and release enzyme and enemy both. In this case enzymes start digesting
other cell membranes. To stop this difficult situation blood flow increases at that place.
So the colour of that place becomes red and becomes hot also. It starts paining also at
that place. This place becomes invalid in doing its job. This situation is called as
Inflammatory Phase.
