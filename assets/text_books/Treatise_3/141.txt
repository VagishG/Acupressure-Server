Â© Fault in Trochlear Nerve (CN IV) may cause slight upward deviation of cornea due
to rolling up of the eyeball.

Treat OR 1 as well as GB 9 (Point of Mid Brain) for the fault in Trochlear Nerve.

Location:
Point located on the upper brow of eye on the medial side in the lateral of Eye 1.
This is VI" cranial nerve. This muscle is responsible for abduction of cornea pole.

It is a motor nerve. Its nucleus is situated at Pons of Brain (UB 9).

Applied Use of this point, to treat :

a

a

Paralysis of abducens nerve causes torticollis as compensation, for double vision.
This is called homonymons diplopia.

Inability to move the eyeball outwards may be due to fault in Abducens
Nerve (VI*).

Internal strabismus (Squint). Squint is incordinated action of the eyeball, so that
the visual axes of the two eyes fail to meet at the objective point.

In the fault of abducens Nerve treat Eye 2 as well as UB 9 (Point of Pons)

ND 4, ND 3a, ND 1a, UB 9, Eye 2, Ly 2a.

Location:

Lateral of Eye 2 on the upper brow of eye.

M. P. Oculomotor Nerve

This is cranial nerve No. 3 the oculomotor nerve innervates four muscles of the eyeball.
The oculomotor nerve innervates one of the three eyelid muscles. Its nucleus is in
Mid Brain (GB 39.)
