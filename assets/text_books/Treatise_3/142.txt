Q

In case of paresis of oculomotor nerve which is muscular elevator of eye, ptosis
(dropping of the upper eyelid also called bleph arostenosis) lateral downward
divergence of the eye will result.

With a complete pareses of the oculomotor nerve, a complete paralytic ptosis
occur.

The pupil is large and fixed, the accomodation paralysed. This is called loss of
accomodation.

There may be crossed diplopa.

Crossed Diplopa : The image of the right eye appears upon the left eye and the
image of the left eye apears upon the right eye. It is also called heteronymous
diplopia.

There may be dilation of the pupil.

There may be loss of light reflex.

There may be inability to move eyeball inwards, downwards and upward
movements are also restricted.

Co-ordination of the movements of the eyes

Eye movements are of three types :

1.
2.
3.

The eye axes moving to the same side i.e. right, left, up or down.
The eye axes moving to the opposite directions i.e. convergence or divergence.

The eye balls rotate round their axes clockwise or anticlockwise.
