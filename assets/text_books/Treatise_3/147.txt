sympathetic nerve supply from superior cervical ganglion and parasympathetic nerve
supply from the facial. The movement of eyelid helps to spread the tears over the
conjunctiva surface. The tears ultimately collect into a triangular area in the inner angle
of the eye. From here it goes to points above the lateral crest of the orbit and below
zygomatic frontal suture.

There are following parts in the tear gland system :

i) | One Tear Gland Treat OR 4a
ii) Tear Ducts Treat OR 14
ii) Two Tear Canalculi Treat UB 1
iv) One Tear Sac Treat UB 1
v) One Nasolacrimal Duct Treat UB 67

Treatment: Ly 2a, Eye 4a, 14, UB 1, 67, 66b, (CMP UB), Tw21,

(PSMP anterior portion of eye) UB 10a

Location:

After Eye 4 above the upper eyebrow on the lateral side.

Dr. Voll has suggested that in problem of retina treat endocrine system and
small intestine and odonton 8 (Lower) also. If there is a problem in Odonton 8 (Lower)
treat Eye-5 and 6 and vice versa.

Ly 2a, Eye-4, 5, 6, Si 1b (LR) CMP small intestine, St 8 (Odonton 5-8 lower SMP),
Ly 2 RP Teeth, GB 1 (PSMP Posterior portion of Eye), Tw 1b CMP Endocrine. The
retina is the innermost layer of the wall of the eye. It is an extremely delicate structure
and is especially adopted to be stimulated by light rays. It is composed of several
layers of nerve cell bodies and their fibres, lying on a pigmented layer of epithelial cells
which attach it to the choroid. The layer highly sensitive to light is the layer of rods and

cones.
