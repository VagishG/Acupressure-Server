Functions of the Retina :
The retina is the photosensitive part of the eye. The light sensitive nerve cells are :

a) Rods

b) Cones

cone are specialised cells of the retina of the eye which are able to distinguish colour.

a) Rods : _ Therods are more sensitive than the cones. They are stimulated
by low intensity of dim light.

b) Cones : _ Thecones are more sensitive to bright light and colour.

Special Note:

Like hemoglobin is important in blood and iron element is important in haemoglobin
same way retina is important for eyes and vitamin A is must for the synthesis of retina.
Therefore, eat more of vitamin A containing food items for the problem in retina like
carrots, milk, fish, leafy vegetables etc.

Applied:
Retinal Detachment :

This is a painless condition. It occurs when a tear or hole in the retina allows fluid to
accumulate between the layers of the retina cells or between the retina and choroid. It
is localised at first but as fluid collects the detachment spreads.

Symptoms :

a) Spots before the eyes.

b) Flashing lights due to abnormal stimulation of sensory cells.

c) Progressive loss of vision

Cause:

In many cases the cause is unknown but it may be associated with :
a) Trauma

b) Tumours
