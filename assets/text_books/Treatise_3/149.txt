In Chinese Acupuncture whenever a gold needle is inserted in any point of the body
that increases the energy there because Gold Needle attracts energy.

In Chinese Acupuncture whenever a silver needle is inserted in any point of the body,
energy disperses from there-results in reduction of energy.

in Chinese Acupuncture treatment of energy is given on guess basis. In Electro
Acupuncture to measure actual energy of every point and every organ, an electronic
instrument named Dermatron is used. In this system treatment is given on the basis
of original diagnosis. Treatment is also given by an electronic instrument. This saves
the therapist from both the situations of giving more than required treatment or less

than required treatment.
