Dr. Voll has suggested that in problems of choroid treat heart and pericardium and
odonton 8 (Wisdom Tooth) lower also. If there is a problem in odonton 8 (Wisdom
Tooth) lower treat Eye 5 and 6 and vice versa.

Choroid is a thin pigmented layer which separates the posterior part of the sclera from
the retina. It is very rich in blood vessels and is a deep chocolate brown in colour. The
choroid remains just behind the retina forming 5/6" of the middle coat of eye.
