Dr. Voll has suggested that in the problems of vitreous body also treat the large intestine
and odonton No. 6 (Lower). Vitreous body is a colourless jelly like transparent mass
which fills the posterior segment (Posterior 4/5") of the eyeball.

Function:

Main function of vitreous humor is to maintain the roundness of the eye.

The vitreous body maintains shape and sufficient intraocular pressure of the eyeball to
support the retina against the choroid and prevent the walls of eyeball from collapsing.
The vitreous body acts as a refractive medium.
