Special Note :

Medium for circulation of aqueous humor in eye is ciliary body. Cornea gets its food
from aqueous humor, not from blood. Because of any obstruction the pressure of
aqueous humor of eye increases, this condition is called Glucoma. In the case of
paralysis of ciliary muscles the pupil gets stagnant in middle.

Location:

Below the eye on the Medial Orbit after Eye 9 medially located point.

Iris is the membrane around the pupil in the eye.

Special Note :

Dr. Voll has suggested that in the problems of Iris also treat biliary system, Gall Bladder

and Odonton 3 lower. Also treat OR 3 Mp for Oculomotor Nerve (CN III) which supplies
the intrinsic muscles of Iris.

The iris is the visible coloured part of the eye and extends anteriorly from the ciliary
body, lying behind the cornea infront of the lens.

The colour of the iris is generally determined and depends on the number of pigment
cells present. Albinos have no pigment cells and people with blue eye have fewer than
those with brown eyes.

In the centre of the iris, there is an aperture the pupil.

Pupil which works as a window for light rays, does accomodation through contraction
and constriction.
