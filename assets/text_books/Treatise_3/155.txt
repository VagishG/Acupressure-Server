M. P. Cornea
Cornea is a transparent membrane in the front part of the eye.
Special Note :

Dr. Voll has suggested that in the problem of the cornea, also treat Liver, Palatine
tonsil, Odonton 3 lower. Dr. Voll has further suggested that temporal headache may
cause problems in the cornea and vice versa. At times a treatment of the temporal
headache simultaneously treats the corneal problems. Corneai opacity may be due to
hyper calcination caused by the hyper parathyroid.

The cornea is transparent. It replaces the sclera over the anterior one sixth
of the eyeball. The cornea is convex anteriorly and is involved in refracting or binding
light rays to focus them on the retina . The normal size of cornea is 11 mm (vertical)
* 12 mm (lateral) x 0.5-1 mm thick.

Function:
1) Cornea allows free entry of light.
2) Cornea acts as a refractive medium.
Cornea gets its nutrition from lymph and aqueous humor. Hence treat Ly 2a R. P.
for Lymph Drainage of eye, to treat cornea.
Intraocular Pressure :
The pressure of humor should be 25 to 30 mm of Hg. The pressure of eye ball can be
felt by palpating the eyeball with two fingers. The pressure is measured with the help of
tonometer. The intraocular pressure becomes high in glaucoma.

Note: Incase of eye donation after the death, comea of the dead person is implanted
to the blind person.
