M. P. Lens

Initially in cataract near vision remains correct only distant things one cannot see
properly. After that cataract starts forming.

Dots/speckles or light points in front of the eye is the problem of lens. In this treat lower
oesophagus.

The lens is the chief refracting medium of the eyeball having the maximum
refracting power. Radius of both the surfaces is different. This radius keeps increasing
- decreasing from ciliary ligament. Hence, for the problem of lens treat ciliary body
also.

Functions of Lens:

The refract light and focus it exactly on retina.

Oxygen (O,) lack and Carbon Dioxide (CO,) excess and other pathological conditions
cause degeneration of the lens. In the young, the lens is rich in cystine necessary for
local tissue oxidation. As the age advances, the cystine content falls. The nutrition of
lens is maintained by the aqueous humour over the lens. Due to malnutrition or dietary
deficiencies, the lens becomes opaque. This condition is known as Cataract.
