M. P. For Optic Nerve

It is Cranial Nerve Il, whose nucleus is in forebrain. In the problem of optic nerve along
with GB 1-1 treat GV 23-1 (Point for fore brain) and ND 3 and GB 14 (Point for lateral
Geniculate body). Optic nerves are nerves of sense of light. The fibres originate in the
retina of the eyes and they combine to from the optic nerve. Optic nerves are directed
backwards. Impulses pass from optic nerves to the centre of sight in the occipital
lobes of cerebrum and to the cerebellum. In the occipital lobe sight is perceived. In the
cerebellum the impulses from the eyes contribute to the maintenance of balance,
posture and orientation of the head in space.

One cannot see if the optic nerve gets cut, when the optic chysma gets cut, one
cannot see towards temples from both the eyes.

â€œWhen optic track gets cut, the eye of that side can see only towards temple and the
other eye can see only towards nose.
