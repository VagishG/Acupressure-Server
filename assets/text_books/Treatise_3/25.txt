It is means inflammation. It denotes that there is more Qi at the site of inflammation.
There is one exception of arthritis. In chronic arthritis there is less Qi at the site of
inflammation.

Degeneration Phase :

Degeneration means deterioration. Degeneration is a change from higher to a lower
or less functionally active form.

When in outer cell liquid, the non-required elements remain present constantly then
the functioning of the cell becomes imbalanced and cell starts degenerating. When

the outer cell liquid becomes free from the non-required elements then cell restores
its health. This is called regeneration. Non required elements are as follows :

1) Glycoprotein

2) Albumin

3) Neutral Fat
4) Lipid

5) Water

6) Fibrin

7) Mucus

In degeneration there is less than neededQi at the site of degeneration. It causes
numbness, lower functional capacity etc. It is denoted by Ose or Sis like paralysis,
neurosis, varicose etc.

Sis includes :

1) Fibrosis

2) Contractions

3) _ Inhibitions

4) Parasymphatic activities
5) Cold

6) Stasis

7) Basic reactions

Degeneration is normally associated with normal ageing but also takes place
prematurely when structures deteriorate causing impaired function.
