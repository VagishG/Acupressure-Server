Body keeps producing homotoxins and regularly expels them out of the body. Whenever
these homotoxins remain in the body, it shows in the form of diseases.

When the homotoxins increase in the body then the cells of the body starts degenerating

and diagnosis purpose. But it has been observed that, diagnosis, through clinical tests
show the disease in the last phase only. But by that time disease become severe and
incurable.

Every illness expresses the effects of homotoxins, that is of substances produced by
the body itself - Dr. Reckweg
