The place where diseases appear is called Focus of Disturbance (Foci). Like is
case of severe pain in tooth, then the focus of disturbance is tooth. But toothache
is only manifestation of diseases of internal organs, joints and endocrine glands
etc. In this case the treatment should be given on focus of disturbance as well as
related organ, endocrine gland, spinal vertebrae etc. for the complete cure.
Treatment only on focus of disturbance will not cure the root cause of the disease
and chances of recurrence of disease will always be there.

Acupuncture. Treatment given according to these protocols cures very old and
chronic diseases amazingly. .
