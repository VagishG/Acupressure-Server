Fundamentals of Electro Acupuncture

Dr. R. Voll has created an electronic instrument called Dermatron. With this instrument
diagnosis and treatment for the diseases of patient is gives. The functionality and
specifications of this instrument are as follows :

f.

Electric resistance of acupoints on the body of patient is measured by the diagnosis
part of the Dermatron.
From 135 milivolt to 2070 millivolt voltage can be measured from this instrument.
Average voltage is 900 millivolt which is denoted at 50 mark on the dial.
Current flowing in the body of the patient can be between 5.50 to 11.25 micro/
ampere of above stated voltage range. This current is so less that the patient do
not get to feel this current. Therefore, patient do not even get to known about the
current given for the diagnosis and treatment by E. A. V. because this current is
far less than the capacity of electric flow in the human body. Therapists can give
treatment only by seeing readings in treatment instrument.

a) When the electric flow is given in the body by Dermatron then 50 unit
on dial indicates that 0.87 volt electric energy resistance is retributed by the
body.

b) Average electric resistance of the human body is 0.87 volt.

Electric resistance is less on Acupoint from the other parts of the body.

The thumb rules of E. A. V. are as follows :

e Average reading is 50.

e Reading more than 80 indicates that the disease in the body is of
inflammatory phase.

e Reading less than 50 indicates that the working capacity in very much
teduced due to chronic and degenerative process. In this electric energy
supply given though E. A. V. instrument starts curing the degenerative process
amazingly. :

e Indicator Drop (|. D.) indicates that the disease is either acute or chronic
along with the cell decay.
