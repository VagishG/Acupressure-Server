Lymph Vessel

vi) To protect the body from cancer, treatment of boils, pus etc. in the body, stopping
of fibroid formation are the main jobs of lymph.
Lymph are of two types :
a) Superficial Lymph
b) Deep Lymph
a) Superficial Lymph : works around the outer body and few internal parts and
superficial area of internal organs.
b) Deep Lymph: it works in the deep of the body and in the internal parts of the
inner organs in the deep.
Treatment on superficial lymph is given in the case of acute and sub-acute diseases
whereas deep lymph treats chronic and deadly diseases like cancer and fibroids at
different parts of the body (because of obstruction of energy). In this ground substance
starts degenerating.
Dr. R. Voll has introduced two types of Lymph meridians in E. A. V. :
a) Lymph vessel (Ly Meridian) : This is a superficial meridian.
b) Organ Degeneration Vessel (OR Meridian) : This is a deep Lymph meridian.
From Ly 14 the Lymph Vessel runs via UB 36 to second branch of Urinary Bladder
Meridian on spine near first thoracic vertebra. UB 36 to UB 49 are points of lymph
drainage which controls the lymph drainage of various internal and external organ.
Details of these points has been given in ‘A Treatise on Advance Acupressure /
Acupuncture Part IV’ in chapter on Urinary Bladder Meridian.
There is another Lymph vessel on Spleen and Pancreas Meridian which runs from SP
9/Pn9 to Sp 21/Pn 21. Details of these points have been given in ‘A Treatise on
Advance Acupressure / Acupuncture Part IV’ in chapter on Spleen Meridian and
Pancreas Meridians.
These points control the lymph drainage of the middle and lower part of organs including
urogenital organs.
Other than this there is one lymphatic drainage point on every organ meridian. This
point regulates the lymph drainage of related organ.
