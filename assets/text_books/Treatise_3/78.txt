R. P. for Lymph drainage of Nose and Paranasal sinuses.

It is considered to be a reference point for a pathological process in the paranasal
cavities and the ethmoid cells.

Sinuses are of 5 types :
e Frontal Sinus : Ly 3, UB 2, Ly 13, 14
e Maxillary Sinus (sinus of Middle Ear) : Ly 3, St5, Ly 14

e Sphenoid sinus (Sinus of cavity from sphenoid bone to nose) : Ly 3, Between
Li20 and UB 1, (SVP 1), Ly 13

e Ethmoid cells (Sinus for the above of inner brow of eyes) : Ly 3, Li20, UB 1 at the
distance of 2/3 from SVP 3.

e Cavernous sinus (from sphenoid fissure to petrous bone's sinus) : Ly 3, Li20 and
SVP 3 at the distance of 2/3rd between UB 1, Ly 13.

C. S. F. (Cerebro Spinal Fluid) drains in cavernous sinus. Hence, for the increased
pressure of C. S. F. treat cavernous sinus.
