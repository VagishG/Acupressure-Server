Pancreas Meridian (Pn Meridian)

Pancreas meridian is only in the right side of the body.

Protein Digestion and Metabolism.
Or
Albumin Metabolism.
Proteins supply amino acids Amino acids build, repair and maintain body tissues and
are vital to everyday body functions. The body needs a constant supply of proteins to
repair body cells, which wear out and to help regulate body processes. proteins are
needed for growth, synthesis of enzymes, plasma proteins, antibodies
(immunoglobulins), and some hormones. Excess protein is excreted by Kidneys as
detached nitrogenous part. First class protein is found in meat, fish, soya beans, milk,
eggs milk products (excluding butter).
Incomplete second class protein is found in cereals and pulses, bread and potatos.
These do not contain all the essential amino acids in correct proportions. Protein is
needed to fight viral infections.
Â© Pancreas produces proteolytic enzymes.
Protein metabolism includes :
e = Trypsin
e Chymotrypsin
These two are produced in Duodenum of Si. They produce amino acid. Deficiency
of these digests the pancreas itself.
e Pancreas - Erepsin and Proteases.

e Pancreas - Protein Zymogenesis.
