Above stated discovered points made it possible to easily treat infection of urine and
genital organs, venereal diseases and dangerious diseases. Points disovered related
to various parts of genital organs made easy to treat prostrate, fallopian tube etc.
Urinary Bladder meridians passes from head. UB 2a CMP brain stem, UB 21 olfactory
nerves-|l and UB 10a-1 accessory nerve (XII) are on this meridian. This discovery
made possible to treat diseases of brain and cranial nerves more effectively.

In EAV following 28 points are redefined on Urinary Bladder, which increases
their usefulness :

6 UB67 Body of Urinary Bladder.
