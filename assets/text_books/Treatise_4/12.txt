Utilisation of amino acids :

i) Inthe Liver to synthesise albumin, globulin, prothrombin and fibrinogen.

il) Cell replacement, cell repair, production of hormones, enzymes and antibodies.

Treat :

a) Albumin ureahere+ K3

b) When there is low production of Albumin, treat Pn 1 alongwtih Liv 3. Albumin is
formed in Liver. It is the most abundant plasma protein and its main function is to
maintain the plasma osmotic pressure at its normal level of 25 mm Hg.

c) Globulin : Itis a group of proteins found in tissues and it differs from the Albumin
in heat.

Globulins work as allergy resistants. Itis produced in Liver and Lymphoid tissues.
Deficiency of Globulin happens in the patients of haemophilia, titnus, allergy, rabies,
immune response to antigen etc.

d) Fibrinogen : It is soluble protein in blood which produces non-soluble protein
named fibrin. Fibrin makes clots of blood to prevent loss of blood. Itis produced in
Liver.

e) Serum: After removing red cells from the blood, the remaining liquid is called
serum. It does not clot because it does not contain clotting factor.

f) Clotting factors : These are substances essential for coagulation of blood.
Treat problems related to albumin, globulin, fibrinogen, serum and clotting
factors here.

Special Note :

Treat disease ofAlbumin Metabolism. here.

White Egg like material is called Albumin.

Protein is a food substance based on compounds of nitrogen essential for body growth
and maintenance, found mainly in the meats, fish, eggs, poultry, chese, milk and the
leguminous vegetables (Pulses).
