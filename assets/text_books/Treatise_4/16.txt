Itis pancreatic excretory duct.

Pancreatic duct opens into duodenum at its mid point. Just before entering the
duodenum, the pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct to form hepatopancreatic
ampulla. The duodenal opening of the ampula is controlled by the hepatopancreatic
sphincter. Fibrosis and distortion of the main pancreatic duct may cause chronic/
acute pancreatitis. Tiny aciner duct by protein material eventually cause obstruction
of common bile duct, causing jaundice. Portal vein obstruction causes venous
congestion.
