i) If S. A. Node is hyperactive the
cardiac rhythm will increase.
ii) If S. A. Node is hypoactive the
cardiac rhythm will decrease
causing bradicardia.
iii) Partial heart block may be due to
delayed conduction.
iv) Ifno impulse is generated from S.
A. Node for one or two beats, there
will be missing beat.
when there is drop in the pulse rate of the patient and functionality of S. A. node reduces
and when imptanlation of Pacemaker becomes necessary then putting a star magnet
on H6a (R) sometimes functions as a pacemaker for the patient.

These are cardiac muscles :

Also treat : Ci 7 Coronary vessel supply.
Ly 5 Lymph supply of epicardium, myocardium below endocardium.
Diagnose:
Myocardosis
Liver congestion is the reason for the less energy in Right Myocardium.
Alarm Point for Heart is CV 14
Q Lymph congestions at heart may cause cardiac pain.
In such case treat Ly 5 also.
Q__ Deficiency at H6 may cause myocardiosis.
Q__ Deficiency of energy in Right Heart and Liver indicates a liver congestion.
