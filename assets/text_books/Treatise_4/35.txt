Fundamentals of Electro Acupuncture

Dr. R. Voll has created an electronic instrument called dermatron. With this instrument
diagnosis and treatmentfor the diseases of patient is given.
The functionality and specifications of this instrument are as follows :

1. Electric resistance of Acu Points on the body of patient is measured by the diagnosis
part of the dermatron.

2. From 1365 milli. volt to 2070 milli volt voltage can be measured from this instrument.
Average voltage is 900 milli volt which is denoted at 50 mark on the dial.

3. Current flowing in the body of the patient can be between 5.50 to 11.25 micro/ampere
of above stated voltage range. This currentis so less that the patient do not get to feel
this current. Therefore, patient do not even get to know about the current given for the
diagnosis and treatment by E. A. V. because this currentis far less than the capacity
of electric flowin the human body. Therapists can give treatment only by seeing readings
in treatment instrument.

4. @ When the electric flow is given in the body by dermatron then 50 unit indicates on
dial that 0.87 volt electric energy resistance is retributed by the body.

e Average electric resistance of the human body is 0.87 volt.

Electronic resistance is less on acu point from the other parts of the body.
6. The thumb rules of E. A. V. are as follows :

e Average reading is 50.

e Reading more than 80 indicates that the disease in the body is of inflammatory
phase.

e Reading less than 50 indicates that the working capacity is very much reduced
due to chronic and degenerative process. In this electric energy supply given
through E. A. V. instrument starts curing the degenerative process amazingly.

e Indicator Drop (I.D.) indicates that the disease is either acute or chronic alongwith

the cell decay.
