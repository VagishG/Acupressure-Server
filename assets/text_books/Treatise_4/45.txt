Acupuncture Point :

Like physical electric energy is stored in electric battery similarly acupuncture points
located on meridians have centralisation of energy. This principle is proved by Dr. R. Voll by
an Electronic Instrument ‘Dermatron’.

Different organs give self produced energy to their own meridians so that they can
direct that energy towards hands and feet. In these meridians through acupuncture points
energy gets stored at a biological optimum level by the body.

If energy increases or decreases in any meridian or energy reduces/increases more
than required in any acupuncture meridian it results in diseases in the body. Treatment of
these diseases are done by giving electric current on those acupuncture points. Dr. Voll
proved through his researches, that acupuncture points take electric current only till that
time once there normal energy reaches potential level. Once energy reaches normal energy
potential level, acupuncture points stop taking more energy on their own. It means that
treatment with Electro Acupuncture balances energy. When there is deficiency of energy in
any organ then treatment by Electro Acupuncture balances the energy.

In Electro Acupuncture 8 to 10 ml. ampere current is given which does not stimulate
our cerebro spinal nervous system. It means that current given in Electro Acupuncture is
only received by related point and cerebrospinal nervous system remains unaffected. In the
case of deficiency of energy in related piont, current gives energy to that point and the
moment normal energy potential level reaches on that point, the point stop taking energy. If
the related point already has excessive energy, then that point does not take any electric
current. This whole process is observed and recorded by reading on indicator. This can
give information about related organ's following phases through each point :

1) Inflammatory phase
2) Degenerative phase
3) Pathological burdening of the organ or the body

4) Normatonic situation
