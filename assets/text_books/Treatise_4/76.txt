Superior branch of colliculi.

Itis responsible for visual reflexes and reflexes altered position of trunk, head, eye and
limbs in response to retinal impulses. This connects superior colliculi with T1 and T2
where the pupil dilator centre is situated.

Reticularis in the mesencephleon.

Zig Zag of nerve plexus in central brain which affects Spinal Cord, Mid Brain and Pons.
An irritation in the reticularis causes irritation of the brain stem and ultimately it affects
the limbic system.

MP somnic centre in the diencephalon.

This is sleep centre in the interbrain or fore brain in the 3rd ventricle which is responsible
for the depth of sleep.

Treat this point for deep sleep.

Sleeping centre in diencephaion is centre to induce sleep.

Lateral Geniculate Body. it is a primary visual centre situated in the diencephalon
(in the brain).
Itis a relay station on the visual pathway. Hence, treat GB 14 in eye vision problems.

Lateral geniculate body works as a transformer of optic nerve. Hence, treat this point
to reduce the swelling and inflammation of optic tract in optic nerve atrophy.
