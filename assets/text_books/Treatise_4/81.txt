Thalamus is :
i) Large avoid mass of grey matter located on either side of the 3rd ventricle.

ii) Itreceives sensations from periphery and sends them to cerebral cortex, basal
ganglion, hypothalamus, reticular formation and intra thalamic fibres.

Ithelps in waking up and alertness alongwith the Nervous System reticular formation
and Limbic system.

Thalamic Syndrome :

Obstruction in artery (Thalamogeniculate Artery) which supplies blood to thalamus
results in patients in the form of deficiency in bone cartilage and incoordinated
movements. Treat this point also in the treatment of optic nerve.

Thalamus :

Itis called the great sensory relay station. This is the great posterior ganglion of the
brain andis the origin of the optic nerve.

e Impairment of all types of sensibilities.

e Joint sense i.e. posture and passive movement are most affected.
e Hemiplegia or Hemiparesis.

e Pleasant and Unpleasant feelings are exaggerated.
