Neutrophils create first protective and lymphocytes create second protective layer.
They are of two types

T Lymphocytes

B Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes are gathered in large number in blood, lymph nodes & spleen.
TLymphocytes:

They get activated by thymus gland in the first stage. They do cellular protection of
body. They give strength to neutrophils and body tissues to fight. If neutrophils loose the
battle then they create plasma cell and eat the enemies.

BLymphocytes:

They are activated by bursa omentalis of liver. They do humeral protection of body.

THROMBOCYTES OR PLATELETS:

Generally these blood cells do the repaire work of worn down capillaries and help in
clotting of blood at the place of bleeding. It is manufactured in the bone marrow. The life
span of the platelets is in between 8 and 10 days and those which are not used are destroyed
in the spleen.

Normal count of thrombocyte or platelets is 2 lac to 3.5 lac/mm>

Total red blood cells (erythrocytes) 4.5 + 0.5 million
Total leukocytes (White blood cell) 4000 to 11,000
Neutrophils 25-70%
Eosinophils 2-4%
Basophils 0-1%
Monocytes 1-4%
Lymphocytes 20-30%

TREATMENT PROTOCOL FOR WHITE BLOOD CELLS:

White blood cells are produced in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues when there is
an attack of infection in the upper or lower part of the body tnen lymph glands of that part of
body gets irritation. In the response to fight this irritation lymph glands manufacture white
blood cells.

Spleen and lymph follicle produces lymphocytes and antibodies to potect the body.
