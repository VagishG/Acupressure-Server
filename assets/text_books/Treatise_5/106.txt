Protein is a food substance based on compounds of nitrogen essential for body growth
and maintenance found mainly in the meats, fish, eggs, poultry cheese milk & the leguminous
vegetables.

Protein in our food gets digested in digestive system and gives amino acids which are
absorbed in intestine. In liver from these amino acids suitable plasma protein synthesizes
for the body.

Metabolism of protein:

(i) Protein food taken as a part of the diet consist of 20 types of amino acids.

(ii) 8 Types of amino acids are essential because they cannot be synthesized in the
human body.

(iii) 12 Types of amino acids are non essential because they can be synthesized in the
human body.

(iv) Amino acids are required for:
a) Building & repairing cell tissues.
b) Producing antibodies, enzymes & hormones.

(v) Excess amino acids cannot be stored & broken down in the liver to amino (NH3) and
then combined with carbon dioxide forms urea and is excreted in the urine

(vi) Remaining excess part is stored as fat.

(vii) Uric acid is synthesized in liver & excreted in the urine.

(viii) Plasma protein & blood clothing factors are synthesized in liver.
(ix) Plasma protein is mainly of four types:

(a) Albumin
(b) â€” Globulin
(c)  Fibrinoges
(d) Serum

(a) Albumin: Albumin is a protein widely distributed throughout the tissues and fluids in the
