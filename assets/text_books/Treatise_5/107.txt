In the total plasma the quantity of albumin in protein is maximum (4.0-5.7 gm%).
Albumin provides colloid osmotic pressure to the blood reduction in pressure result
in swelling.

These are the following reason for hypoalbuminaemia:

Liver cirrhosis

Starvation

GL-T. disease

Renal Disease

Burn Injuries.

Globulin:

Globulin works as antiallergic in the body. Globulin is a group protein found in animal
tissues. In the total plasma the quantity of globulin in protein is 1.5-3.0X.gm% globulin
are of three types:

a) Alpha Globulin

b) Beta Globulin

c) Gamma Globulin

Both the alpha globulin and beta globulin get synthesized in liver. Therefore in the
disease liver they can be in reduced quantity.

Gamma globulin makes antibody for the body synthesis of gamma globulin is done by
various lymphoid tissues of body. Deficiency of this reduces the immunity of the body.
It is known as agammaglobulinaemia. This condition can be because of hereditary
radiation loss or glaucoma in which lymphoid tissue atrophy happens.

Fibrinogen:

Itis a soluble protein in blood. Which produces insoluble protein named fibrin. It produces
clots is blood to stop bleeding. It is produced in liver. The quantity of fibrogen in total
plasma is 0.5-1.0 gm% at the time of injury for the blood clotting fibrinogen is required
deficiency of this makes clots slowly in the blood and therefore bleeding increases
Serum:

After removal of red blood cells from blood the remaining part is called serum. There is
No clotting factor in this so clots cannot be formed in this treatment protocol for protein
digestion & metabolism & albumin metabolism:
