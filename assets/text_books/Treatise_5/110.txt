Uric Acid Metabolism

Itis an acid formed in the break down of nucleoproteins in the tissues and excreted in
the urine.

Urea, creatinine & uric acid are the waste products of protein metabolism. They are
formed in the liver and are sent to kidney for secretion carbondioxide excreted by all cells is
to sent to lungs for excretion.

Liver breaks down nucleo protein of worn out cells of the body to form uric acid, which
is excreted in urine.

When there is over production of uric acid or when there is defective excretion by the
kidneys, the level of blood uric acid increases.

Excess production of uric acid may be due to excess large scale cell destruction.

Gout is caused by deposition of sodium urate crystals in the joints & tendons.

It occurs in some people, whose blood uric acid level is abnormally high.

Big toe of right leg is mostly affected first and then ankle, knee, wrist & hip joints may
be affected. In many cases only one joint is affected. It is more present in men than women.
