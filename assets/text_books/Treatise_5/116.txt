The food taken contains fats.

The pancreas produces esterases & lipases enzymes.

These enzymes dissimilate the fat.

Bile produces steapsin enzyme.

Steapsin enzyme activates lipase.

Digested fats are absorbed as fatty acids & glycerol into lacteals.

Then they are transported to liver via cystema chyli & thoracic duct to blood strearr -

Fatty acid & glycerol circulating in the blood are used by cells of organs & glands to
provide energy & synthesis of their secretions.

(vii) In liver a part of fatty acid & glycerol are used to provide energy & heat.

) Remaining part of fatty acid & glycerol are used for triglycerides in liver.
Triglycerides consists of three fatty adds, chemically combined with a glycerol molecule.

As & When need, the triglycerides are converted back to fatty acid & glycerol and used
to provide energy.
For complete oxidation of fatty acids & glycerol, oxygen & glucose are required.

(xii) Fat is synthesised from excess carbohydrate and protein and is stored in fat depots

}) There are three forms of fat in the serum of food:

(a) Triglycerides

(b)  Cholestrol

(c) Phospholipids

All the lipids are non dissoluble in water. Therefore along with opoprotein which

roduced by liver they make complex known as lipoprotein. They are dissoluble in water.
