Dr. R. Voll Excess or reduced serous coat results peritonitis or adhesion respectively.
Organ becomes painful in both types of dieseases (Peritonitis & Adhesion) Serous
membrane coating point is the treatment for both the types of dieseases.

0 ALP. (Autonomic Innervations Point)

In each organ's meridian there is an autonomic Innervations points which connect
the organ to the spinal cord and gets the continuous nutrition and instructions for the
autonomic function from brain through spinal cord. It is also called automatic steering
point. Treatment on this point treats autonomic Plexus of the related organs and
