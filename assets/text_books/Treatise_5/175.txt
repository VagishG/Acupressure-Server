Glaucoma

Glaucoma is increased intraocular pressure due to defective drainage of aqueous
fluids. It causes visual impairment from minor to complete blindness.

When inflow of aqueous human of eye increases and outflow reduces then pressure
increases inside the eye

Glaucoma is of two types:

(i) Primary Glaucoma

(ii) | Secondary Glaucoma

Primary Glaucoma

It is also of two types

(i) Chronic open angle Glaucoma.

(ii) Acute closed angle Glaucoma.
(a) Chronic open angle Glaucoma:

In this, Intra Occular pressure increases gradually and visual capacity reduces. First
one cannot see peripheral but can see is front.

In this, atrophy of optic disc occurs. It happens in both the eyes and happens in people
above the age of 40.It is generally heriditory.

(b) Acute closed angle Glaucoma:

It generally happens in people above the age of 60 years. In this usually one eye affects.
Following reasons are there for this type of Glaucoma.

(i) Diameter of comea reduces from 11 mm, otherwise usually this should be 11.6 mm.
(i) | The anterior chamber is flattened

(iii) The lens is relatively large.

Due to all the four reasons chamber angle narrows down.

Sudden glaucoma attack can happen due to following reasons:

(i) The congestion in the pigment layer of the eyeball results in congestion of ciliary body.
(i) It results in increase in secretion of fluid by the ciliary gland.

(iii) It causes glaucoma.
