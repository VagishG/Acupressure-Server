Larynx starts from the root of the tongue and goes to trachea trough hyoid bone. It is
also called voice box.

Functions Of Larynx:
Production of sound is done by the larynx .
There are three Qualities of Voice:
(1) Pitch of voice
(2) Volume of voice
(3) | Resonance or tone of voice
1) Pitch of the Voice:

It depends on the length & tightness of the cord. At puberty, the male vocal cords begin
to grow longer, hence the lower pitch of the adult male voice.

2) Volume of the Voice:

Volume of the voice depends upon the force with which the cord vibrates. The greater
the force of expired air the more the cords vibrate & larger the sound emitted.

To increase the expired air force treat Lu7, It will increase the volume of voice. To
increase the force with which cord vibrater, treat H5.
3) Tone of Voice:

Tone of voice is dependent upon the shape of the mouth, the position of the tongue &
lips, the facial muscles & the air in the Para nasal sinuses.

Speech occurs during expiration when the sounds produced by the vocal cords are
manipulated by the tongue, cheeks & lips.

Protection of Lower Expiry Tract:

During Swallowing, the larynx moves upwards occluding the opening into it from pharynx,
this ensures that food passes in to the oesophagus and not into the lower respiratory
passages.
