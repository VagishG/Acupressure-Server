Salivary Glands

In digestive system, saliva is the first digestive juice there pairs of glands secrete
saliva in mouth they are as follows:

2 Parotid Glands

2 Submandibular Glands

2 Sublingual Glands

These three paired glands secretes 1 to 1.5 litres of saliva daily. Saliva secretes
continuously but the secretion increase at the time of food in the mouth.
Parotid Glands

Just below the external acoustic meatus of outer ear, there is parotid gland on both the
sides of the face.there is parotid gland duct in mouth on the surface of second upper molar
tooth. It secretes 20% of saliva.
Sabmandibular Glands

Below the angle of jaw on both the sides of face there is one submandibular gland
which are the glands of lower jaw. There are two ducts of lower jaw which opens in the
bottom of mouth. It is situated on both the sides of trenulum of the tongue. It secretes 75%
of saliva.
Sublingual Gland

In front of the glands of lower jaw, there are glands on the bottom of mouth under the
tongue. There are small- smallducts in this which is located in the mucous membrane of
the bottom of mouth this gland secrete 5% of saliva.
Nerve Supply of Salivary Gland

All the three salivary glands get supply of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve.
Parasympathetic nerve supply increase the flow of saliva and sympathetic nerve supply
reduces the flow of saliva.

Flow of saliva is controlled by autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic stimulation
does vasodilation which increases the secretion of water element in saliva but reduces
enzyme and other organic substances relatively. Sympathetic stimulation does vaso

constribution in which the amount of salvia decreases but enzymes and organic material
are more in this once food is there in the mouth saliva secretes due to reflex action on
