Oesophagus

From mouth food reaches to stomach through oesophagus. This oesophagus is 25
cm long and of 2 cm diameter. Where oesophagus meets in stomach there it turns from
down to upwords. This turning stops the food from going back to mouth again. It prevents
regurgitation ( back ward flow) of gastric contents in the oesophagus.

Oesophagus has two parts:

1. Upper oesophagus

2. Lower oesophagus
1) Upper Oesophagus:

Upper part of oesophagus is connected with pharynx and food enters from here, in
oesophagus. There is one sphincter muscle here which is called cricopharyngeal sphincter
this sphincter stops wind at the time of breathing from going into oesophagus.

2) Lower oesophagus:

This is lowest and last part of oesophagus. It is connected with stomach. Sphincter
muscles are there which are known as lower oesophageal sphincter. This sphictur musele
stops food from going back to oesophagus. From stomach by contration & relaxation process
food goes from oesophagus to stomach.
