0 Phases of disease in the body
There are six different stages of self poisoning process in the body.

Excretion Phase

Reaction Phase Humeral Phase
Deposition Phase

Impregnation Phase

Degeneration Phase Cellular Phase
Cancer or Malignat Disease Phase

First three phases (Excretion reaction, Deposition) are called ‘Liquid' and 'Semi
Liquid’ phase humeral process, in this phase there is no change in the chemical
composition of cell. Last there phases (Impregnation, Degeneration and Malignant)
are known as cellular phase. In the cellular phase change, destruction and
deterioration starts in the cell. These last there phase can be diagnosed by chemical
tests.

In the humeral process when deposition starts at various places in the body then
sometimes diagnosis can be done by chemical tests and sometimes chemical tests are
not helpful. By electro Acupuncture, diagnosis of both the phases or process (ie human
process and cellular process) and the stage of disease in those six phases is possible.
Treatment can be given accordingly and could prevent the patient from the various disease

of future.
