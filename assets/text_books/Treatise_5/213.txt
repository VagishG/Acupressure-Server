Gonadotrophic hormone secreted by the anterior lobe of pitutary gland stimulate the
male reproductive organ.

Follicule stimulating Hormone (FSH) stimulates the seminiferous tubules of the testes
to produce the spermatozoa.

The sperm passes through epididymis, deferent canal, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory
duct & the urethra before if enters the vagina during coitus.

The ejaculation consists of 2 to 5 million semen containing 40 to 100 million sperms
per ml.

Testes lowers the temperature of the sperms by 3Â°C lower than the body temperature.
Semen is a fluid ejaculated during coitus. It consists of :

i) Sperms

ii) A fluid secreted by seminal vesicle which facilitates motility of sperms.

iii) Lubricating fluid secreted by the prostrate gland.

iv) | Mucus secreted by urethra.
