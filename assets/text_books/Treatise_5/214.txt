Pulmonary Blood Supply :

The pulmonary artery is divided into two parts, each part supplies deoxygenated blood
to each lung. Each pulmonary artery divides into many branches which forms capillary
network around the walls of alveoli. The exchange of gases between air in the alveoli and
blood in the capillaries takes place across the two very fine membranes.

The pulmonary capillaries join up and becomes pulmomary vein carrying oxygenated
blood to left atrium of the heart.
