Fundamentals of Electro Acupuncture

Dr. R. Voll has created an electronic instrument called Dermatron with this
instrument diagnosis and treatment for the disease of patient is given. The
functionality and specification are as follows :

1. Electric resistance of acu point on the body of patient is measured by the diagnosis
part of the dermatron.

2. From 135 millivolt to 2070 millivolt voltage can be measured through this instrument.
Average voltage is 900 millivolt which is denoted at 50 mark on the dial.

3. Current flowing in the body of the patient can be between 5.50 to 11.25 micro/ampere
of above stated voltage range. This current is so less that the patient do not get to
feel this current. Therefore patient even do not get to know about the current given
for the diagnosis and treatment by E.A.V. because this current is far less than the
capacity of electric flow in the human body. Therapists can give treatment only by
seing readings in treatment instrument.

4. When the electric flow is given in the body by Dermatron then 50 unit indicates on
dial that 0.87 volt electric energy resistance is retributed by the body.

Average electric resistance of the human body is 0.87 volt.

5. Electric resistance is less on acupoint from the other parts of the body

6. The thumb rules of E.A.V. are as follow :

e Average reading is 50

e Reading more than 80 indicates that the disease in the body is of
inflammatory phase.

e Reading less than 50 indicates that the working capacity is very much
teduced due to chronic and degenerative process. In this electric energy
supply given through E.A.V. instrument starts curling the degenerative
Process amazingly.

Â¢ Indicator drop (|.D) indicates that the disease is either acute or chronic
along with the cell decay.

Acupuncture Point :
Like physical electric energy is stored in electric buttery similarly acupuncture
