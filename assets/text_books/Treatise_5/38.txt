energy of nervous system is called nerve Impulse. These nerve impulses are like tiny electric
charges. These nerve impulses flow through neurons and actually the strength of nerve
impulse remains same throughout the full length of neurons. These are relay centres in
between which transmit impulses forward and sometimes redirect them.
