The Respiratory Centre :
It controls the rate and depth of respiration. The respiratory centres are situated in the
following parts of brain.
i) Medulla oblongata : Inspiratory and expiratory neurons are situated here.
ii) Pons : Pneumotaxic and opneustic centres, which controls the inspiratory and
expiratory neuron of the medulla are situated here.
iii) Motor impulses leaving the respiratory centre go to the diaphragm via phrenic
nerve and go to the intercoastal muscles via the intercoastal nerves.

Chemoreceptors

These receptors respond to the changes in the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon
dioxide in the blood and the C.S.F. (Cerebro Spinal. Fluid.)

i) Central chemoreptors are situated on the surface of the medulla oblongata and
are bathed in the cerebrospinal fluid when the carbon dioxide level rises the
arteries even slightly, the central Chemoreceptors stimulates the respiratory
centre, which in turn increases ventilation of the lungs there by the arterial Co,
level is reduced.

Perpherial Chemoreceptors :

These receptors are situated in arch of aorta and the carotid body. When the arterial
Coz level rises they convey impulses to the medulla via glassopharyngeal nerve and vagus
nerve. The respiratory centre is thus stimulated and the rate and depth of breathing is
increased.

When the blood acidity increases (decreases pH ratio), the peripherial chemoreceptors
gets stimulated. This results in increased ventilation. More Co, is excreted. Thus the blood
pH is reduced.
