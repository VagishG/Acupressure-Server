Effects of Sympathetic Stimulation

Heart \t accelerates the working of sinuatrial Node (S. A. Node). Thus it
increases the rate & force of heart beat.
Coronary Arteries _| It causes dilation of coronary arteries.
Thus increases the blood supply to the heart muscles.
Skeleton Blood Skeleton blood vessel dilate. Thus supply of blood, oxygen &
Vessels nutrition to skeleton muscles increases. It increases the body

muscles power to work.

Blood Pressure

It raises blood pressure by constricting the small arteries in the
skin. Thus more blood supply is available for skeleton muscles,
heart, brain etc.

Blood Coagulation

Blood coagulation is faster due to vaso constriction.

Secretory Glands of
Digestive System

It constructs the blood vessels in the secretory glands of digestive
system. It reduces the flow of digestive juices.

Bronchi It dilates the bronchi.
Thus more air can be inhaled oxygen intake increases. Carbon di
oxide output increases.

Stomach i) Smooth muscle contraction is reduced.

ii) Secretion of digestive juices is reduced.

iii) It delays the digestion & onward movement & absorption of food.
iv) The tone of sphincter muscle is increased. It closes the sphincters
V) It reduces the peristalsis.

Small Intestine &
Large Intestine

i) Vasoconstriction is done.

ii) It reduces the peristalis & tone.
iii) Motility is reduced.

iv) Sphincter is closed.
