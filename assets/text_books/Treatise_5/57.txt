of body then it occurs an both the sides left & right upper Quadrant syndrome. Like for

CMP pancreas Pn1a (R)

Sp 1 & Sp 2(L)

Also treat the concerned points of the allergy or vascular degeneration vassal.

Please note that in the horizontal irritation always all 12 CMPs are affected (6 on left
hand and 6 on right hand) + Sp1, Sp2, (L) +Pn 1a (R) + SMP for foci on both hands or on the
