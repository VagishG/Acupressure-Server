Cranial Nerves

There are 12 pairs of nerve direct coming out of brain are called cranial nerves. Among
these 11 cranial nerve are limited from head to neck, Crannial nerve no X which is called as
vagus nerve start from brain and goes to thorax, abdomen & pelvic region.

1. Carnial Nerve No | Olfactory Nerve

This nerve starts from the roof of the nose and ends at the frontal lobs of cerebrum.
This nerve is related to smell once this nerve gets damaged then due to disappearance of
olfaction patient even do not get the smell of the food that confuses patient about the
disappearance of taste from food. In this case olfactory system to be cured.

Olfactory nerve gets affected by tumor in frontal lobes or other problems. So treatment
should be given for frontal lobe of brain alongwith the olfactory nerve.

2. Carnial Nerve No Il: Optic Nerve

Start from the membrane of retina of eye comes out of cranium orbit crosses forebrain
in opposite side and ends at lateral geniculate body. From here optic radiation fibres reach
in occipital lobe.

Disease of optic nerve & their causes:

(i) In lesion with anterior fossa of skull or frontal lobe, optic nerve can get best.
This can result is monocular blindness.

(ii) Tumor in pitutory gland and carotid anverysm (extra ordinary enlargement of
ortery of neck) besets optic nerve results in bitemporal hemianopsiam (means reduction in
the temporal field of both eyes)

(iii) In tumor of mid brain or in meningitis, optic tract also gets involved and causes
homonymous hermianopia. In this vision loss happens at the same temporal side where
the nerve gets beset.

(iv) Beset of optic radiation or occipital lobe homonymous hermian occur. In this
also where the nerve gets beset on that same side vision loss happens.

(v) Hypertension and diabetes cause retinopathy

(vi) In optic Atrophy, optic nerve becomes palor and this reduces the capacity of
