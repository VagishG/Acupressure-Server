Brain

Human brain is of almost 50 gms is weight, which is nutritioned and protected inside
three layers of our skull. And floats in cerebro spinal fluid weight of head is 50th part of the
total weight of the body. Usually a 70 kgs person's head is of 1400 gms.

Brain & spinal Card:

Brain is enveloped with three layers called menings. These menings are located between
skull and brain. In the same way, in spinal cord these menings are located.
These are the following types of menings:

(1) Dura matter the outer layer of brain
(2) Arachnoid matter brain covering layer like spider web.
(3) Pia Matter the inner most layer of brain membrane

Near skull there are 2 layers of dura matter below this there is a layer of arachnoid
matter and below this & near to brain there is a layer called pia matter. The outer layer of the
dura matter acts as a peritoneum for the internal layer of skull. The inner layer of dura
matter protects brain. Blood of veins of brain drains in between these two layers of dura
matter
Cerebro Spinal Fluid:

Cerebro spinal fluid gives support to brain and spinal cord. And protect them also. It
maintains equal pressure around the brain. It works as a shock absorber between the
bones of skull and brain. It keeps brain and spinal cord moist Choroid plexus secretes
0.5ml/min cerebro spinal fluid continually this any 120 ml. C.S.F. secretes in a day. Almost
this much of C.S.F. get absorbed. Extra C.S.F. is drained out by cavernous sinus in brain &
spinal cord total 120 ml. & C.S.F. remains.
