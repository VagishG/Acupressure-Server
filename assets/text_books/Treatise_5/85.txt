Protocol for the Treatment of Degenerative Processes

In E.A.V. treatment of degenerative processes anywhere in the human body
can be done by two methods :

4 By a treatment on vagus nerve (Para-sympathetic nerve), sympathetic nerves
& Tuber Linereum.

2. By a treatment on organ degeneration meridian, Tuber Cinereum, & Vagus

Nerve.
Special Instruction & Notes:

a) Tuber cinereum (MP GB 8) is the centre for measuring the degeneration
processes.

b) After giving treatment on vagus nerve etc, the degenerative process is again
checked at M.P. Tuber Cinereum (GB 8). In fact the tuber cinereum gives indications of the
different stages of degeneration & helps in assessing whether degeneration has ceased
and regeneration has started up.
