Paraplegia:

Paralysis of both the legs is called paraplegia. Paraplegia is of two types:

1) Spastic Paraplegia

2) â€” Flaccid Paraplegia
(1) Spastic Paraplegia:

It is also known as upper motor neuron paralysis it is due to injury of spinal cord,
compression or inflammation. Both the legs stiff and legs cannot bend on the joints. There
can be problem in excretion of stool urine and one can experience sensory loss on the
surface of body.

(2) Flaccid Paraplegia:

It is also known as lower motor neuron paralysis. Both the legs and hands become
loose and legs bend very easily on joints.

When there is spinal compression then spastic paraplegia occurs and when there is flaccid
paraplegia then generally paralysis of one muscle occurs.
