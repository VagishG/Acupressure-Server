Introduction of extra ordinary.vessels :

The word extra ordinary refers to wonderous, rare, strange, some thing exceptional,
unusual & unparallel. The word vessel means a larger, less linear container. The largest
vessels of water on the earth are seas or oceans. The largest reservoirs of Qi in the
human body are these extra ordinary vessels. The main meridians are like rivers and the
eight extra ordinary vessels are like reservoirs or dams or seas, where excess of energy is
stored & kept reserved for use as and when needed.

“When there are heavy rains, canals and ditches are full to the brim.............similarly,
the extraordinary vessels are left out of the channel system, so that they can take the
overflows from the main channels."

(Chapter 27 of Classics of Difficulties)

“If the meridians are full, this fullness goes into the eight extra ordinary vessels, never to
return”
(Nan Jing)
Hence, the main function of the eight extra ordinary vessels is to absorb the excess
energy of the main meridians and to transfer this energy to the main meridians, when
needed. For example, in case of shock the main meridians have severe dirth (#4) of
energy and an emergency supply of energy is needed by the main meridians & organs. A
§.0.S. message goes to the extra ordinary meridians via the brain and the extra ordinary
vessels supply the required energy and saves the life. In other words we can say that the
eight extra ordinary vessels are life savers.
