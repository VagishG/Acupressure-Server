‘ Chong Mo

6. "The Chong Mo is the ocean of 12 meridians, its upper shu point is UB 11 & its lower shu

points are St 37 & St 38.

Excess blood, the body feels full, deficient blood, the body feels small.

"Ling Shu"

a) According to Dr. R.Voll.of Germany UB 11 is the treatment point for the energetic
situation of the entire spine. Since UB 11 is the upper shu point of the Chong Mo, the
Chong Mo also improves the energetic situation of the entire spine.

b) St 37 is the lower he sea point of the large intestine & St 38 is the lower he sea point
of the small intestine, the Chong Mo improves the digestive activities in the large
intestine & the small intestines.

c) UB 11, St 37 & St 38 together tonify blood in the whole body. With these three points
treat Chong Mo master & coupled point Sp 4 & P 6 to regulate the quantity, quality &
pressure of blood in the body.

. "The Chong Mo and Governing Vessel combined are the way of 12 meridians. If the
Chong Mo & the Governing Vessel do not function correctly, the 12 meridians do not
return to the great meeting of vessels Lu 9." .

“Nan Jing”

Lu 9 is the meeting point of the blood vessels of the entire body. This is why the pulse
is felt near Lu 9. Lu 9 influences all the blood vessels & all the pulses.

The lungs govern the Qi. The Qi in the blood is governed by Lu9. Therefore Lu 9 can
influence all blood vessels & can be used for :

Poor circulation

Cold hands & feet

Chiblains ous & flag wea, ea aa

Varicose veins. fraisil @1 Bert

The Chong Mo controls most of the parasympathetic function of the body & the Gov-
erning vessel controls most of the sympathetic functions and Lu 9 is the controller of

both the parasympathetic & sympathetic functions.

In case of problems of the pulse or blood vessels treat Lu 9 along with mas-
ter & coupled points of the Chong Mo (Sp 4 & P 6) and/or the Governing Vessel
(Si 3 & UB 62), as the case may be.
