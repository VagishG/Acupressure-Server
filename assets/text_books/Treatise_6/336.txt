Pathway:
Main meridian pathway :

Governing Vessel originates on the perineum & ascends up the spine and goes to brain
through occipit via Gv 16. It then runs upto the top of the skull & descends down to the
forehead to the base of the nose ie philtrum (sis @1 Wa). Here it meets the conception
vessel & the stomach meridian.

Connecting meridian pathway :
From Gv 1 a special connecting meridian goes upwards along both sides of the spine to
the occipit from where it goes to the top of the head. At the scapulae a branch joins the

urinary bladder meridian & the upper spine (See figure).
