Diabetes

Diabetes is a disease characterised by the chronic excretion of very large amount of
urine of low specific gravity, accompanied by extreme thirst.

ii) Exhausted spleen, exhausted middle and exhausted kidneys are each a form of
diabetes.

iii) Diabetes is related to “exhaustion caused by thirst”.

iv) Deficiency of the fluids, the Jin and Yin of the lungs, spleen or kidneys, caused fire
heat to increase.

v) This in turn caused dryness & great thirst.

vi) According to Su ken following are the three symptoms of exhaustion

“Stomach organ deficiency (eating too much but still hungry).

Kidney thirst (drinking 100 cups & still thirsty). Mind & sexual desire disharmonious”.

Treat K 3 to correct the disharmony of mind & sexual desire.

Treat St 36 to treat the hunger.

According to Su ken, dryness of the earth element is the cause of excessive thirst. The
earth is not controlling the chemical transformation of food & body fluids.

The ‘exhausted middle’ means heat in the middle warmer causing spleen deficiency.
This hidden yang steams the stomach and exhausts the grain Qi. It causes constant hun-
ger but one is unable to put flesh on the body. This is accompanied by frequent & volumi-
nous urinations.

Exhausted kidneys refer to excess heat in the lower warmer causing kidney deficiency,
thinness of the thighs and knees, sore joints, spermatorrhea, drinking too much fluids &
frequent urination. This is the lower warmer diabetes.
