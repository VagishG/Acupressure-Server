Chinese concept of edema

1. Oedema arises from the deficiency of either spleen, lungs or kidneys or all three of
them.

2. Lungs, spleen and kidneys are the three organs that are mostly involved in the
transformation & transportation of fluids. If one or two or three of these organs are
deficient, the body fluids are not transformed properly. The body fluids overflow out
of the channels & settle in th space under the skin. This is the origin of edema.

i) Lungs Qi Deficiency Edema affects the top part of the body including face &
hands. It can also be caused by external wind cold interfering with the lungs
function of dispersing & descending the body fluids.

ii) Spleen Qi Deficiency Edema affects the middle part of the body such as
abdomen (ascites).

iii) Kidney Yang Deficiency Edema affects the lower part of the body such as legs
& ankles.
