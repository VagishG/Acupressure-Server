YIN & YANG

Definition of Acupuncture
Yin and Yang are the most important principle of Chinese Acupuncture.

The entire treatment of acupuncture is done according to Qi and Yin and Yang principle.
According to the logic of Aristotle, we say whether the table is square or not square. Actually
teeth both these statements can't be wrong. This is basis of western thought for the last
2000 years.

The Chinese yin and yang principle is absolutely a different concept. Yin and Yang are
mutually opposite but are complimentary to each other.

1. Yincontains seeds of yang & yang contains seeds of yin :
‘Acanalso be non A’.

2. Nature of Yin Yang Concept
Yin and Yang are related to the dark and sunny sides of a hill.

Day corresponds to yang Night corresponds to Yin
Activity corresponts to yang Rest corresponds to Yin
Light corresponts to yang Shade corresponds to Yin
Sun corresponds to yang Moon corresponds to Yin
Brightness corresponds to yang Darkness corresponds to yin

3. The cyclic movement of Yin Yang. The night comes after the day and the day
comes after the night:

Heavenis Yang Earth is Yin

Round is Yang Square is Yin

Time is Yang Space is Yin

Sun rises in the east Sun sets in the west
So east is Yang So westis Yin

The king used to sit facing South towards the subject and the subject sat facing North
towards the king. The king received energy from the South from heaven and so South
is the upper heaven and North is the earth below. So, when facing South, the King’s
left hand points to East and the right hand points to the West.
