Treatment of Heart Diseases in Chinese Acupuncture
Function of Heart :
Heart is considered as the ruler & emperor of body's internal organs.
“The Heart is like the monarch & it governs the mind...”
(Chapter 8 of “Simple Question”)
“The Hearts like the monarch of trhe five yin organs & the six yang organs & itis the
residence of the mind.”
(Chapter 71 of “Spiritual Axis”)
0 The Heart performs the following important functions :
1) The heart governs entire body's blood;
2) The heart controls entire body's blood channels;
3) The heart reflects in the face's colour, structure & texture;
4) The heartis the residence of mind;
5) The heart opens in the tongue;
6) The heartcontrols sweat.
1) Heart governs Blood:
The heart governs blood in two ways:
a) _ itcirculates the blood in all parts & organs of the body;

b) _ ittransforms food qi into blood. For circulation of blood upto all the tissues of the
body, a healthy heartis essential.

When the heart blood is deficient, blood circulation slows down & hands& feet may
become cold. The patient's tongue may have a shallow crack in the central line; his
heart & kidneys pulse becomes weak.

Ifthe heart is strong, blood supply is deficient, blood circulation is adequate, then the
person will be healthy all his life.

2) Heart controls the Blood Channels :
Blood channels are dependent upon blood & heart qi.
If heart Qi is strong, then blood channels’ state will also be strong & the pulse will be
full & regular.
