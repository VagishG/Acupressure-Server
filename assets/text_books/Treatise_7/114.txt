6. Heart Controls the Sweat :
There is close relationship between blood & body fluids. When blood becomes viscous,
body fluids enter the blood & thin the blood. When blood becomes thin, then the extra
water is passed on in the body or the kidney evacuates it through urine.
When a person is bleeding, then he should not be allowed to sweat since then it will
result in blood becoming thin. Those who bleed should not be given dry food & drying
foods.
“Big Bleeding do not cause sweat
Big sweat do not cause Bleeding”
(Chapter 18 of “Spiritual Axis")
The heart is the controller of both blood & sweat. When qi becomes deficient in the
heart & there is excessive sweating, Heart yang should be toned.
When Heart yin is deficient, night sweating takes place. In such a case, Heart yin
should be toned.
When there uis extra sweating , heart should be treated. During Heart attack, the
patient gets chest pain specially on the left side which extends upto the left hand &
pain on the path of Heart meridian or Pericardium meridian & the patient continuously
‘sweats. In the form of sweat, body fluids reduce, blood becomes viscous & its quantity
reduces.
O Sleep & Dreams:
Heart is the residence of Mind. When the heart is healthy & there is adequate
quantity of blood, then the sleep is fast & deep.
When there is deficiency of energy in the heart, then sleep comes late & there are
more dreams.
When heart is weak, dreams are of fire or mountains, smoke & fire are ‘seen’.
When heart Qiis excess, dreams are of laughter.
© Effect of external weather on Heart :
Normally, it may be stated that external weather does not affect heart; only hot
weather attack the heart, they penetrate the Pericardium instead.
