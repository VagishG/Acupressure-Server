fluids, in the same way at the metaphysical level, the small intestine provides us power
to recognize good / bad, real / artificial, pure / impure, useful / harmful, right / wrong
etc. This power enables us to take the decision. What we have to do & what not to do?

Relation of Heart & Small Intestine :

According to five element theory, Heart & Small intestine organs are related to
Fire elements. Heart is Yin organs & Small intestine is Yang organs.

Heart stores the mind & governs the mental life. Sound mind is needed for sound
mental life, for which proper functioning of heart is necessary.

Small intestine gives the capacity needed for taking clear judgement & decisions.
Hence both Heart & small intestine help in decision making & judgement.

Gall bladder provides us courage & strength to exercise judgement. Small intestine
provides clearity of thinking. So that the problem may be adequately analised.
Correct analysis enables correct decision making; despite correct analysis, if a
person is unable to take the correct decision, then the cause is imbalance in Gall
bladder. In such a situation, treatment at GB40 gives necessary courage to take
the correct decision. When the correct decision making, there is lack of correct
thinking & analysis, then treatment at Si 5, clears doubts in the mind & life gets a
correct direction. When due to increase of heat in the heart symptoms like excess
thirst, bitter taste, ulcers on tongue & blood in urine occur, then heat in heart
should be transferred to the small intestine.

Effect of Food on Small intestine :

Excessive hot type of foods increase the heat in small intestine & excwssive
cold type of foods increase coldness in the small intestine.
