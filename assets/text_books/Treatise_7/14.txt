Acupuncture

First the fate is determined, then the body

As were the deeds, so becomes the fate
Essence-by-birth, we call fate,

Foras many days, essence-by-birth in received, sois
the life span

Counted breaths only are received
Counted heart beats only are received

Counted time for life is received

Measured essence-by-birth are received

Essence-by-birth is like an atom

Essence-by-birth cannot increase
But quality can improve

When food, life style and behavior
Are balanced

When deeds are of high quality
Then essence-by-birth improves.

Synthesizing it, one can achieve greatness
Proper utilization, generates enormous energy
Wrong utilization, generates causes destruction

When inactive energy expires
When active, energy is inspired

Itis stored in Kidney

Air, Water, Food make essence during life
As the food, so is the mind.
Essence-by-birth and Essence-during-life
Both together make

Kidney essence

It flows in B.E.O.V. (Eight extra ordinary vessels)
Excessive increase, power to reproduce, progress
Maturity it gives.
