Head and Body :

Head is above (superior/upper) and body is below (inferior/lower), so comparatively,
structurally head is Yang and body is Yin. Head is that location where all yang meridians
start or end. All yang meridians meet at heat or flow there. When yang energy is in
excess than necessary, then fire or heat increases. This heat first of all affects the
head; this face and eyes become red. Head is also affected by external wind and
summer heat.

When yang energy is depleted in the body, then to tone it, treatment is done an the
yang meridian points n the head.

Chest and stomach are related to yin energy. So chest and stomach are effected by
yin pathological factors like cold and humidity.

Therapists should know that wind and heat first attacks head and cold and humidity
attack first on the body. Keeping this as indications, yin / yang protocols for treatment
should be framed.
