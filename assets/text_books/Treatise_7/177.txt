12, Structure and Function of Organs :

The structure of an organ is connected with yin. Any change in organ’s shape, size or
structure, yin is treated.

The function of an organ is connected with yang. Any disturbance in an organ’s
functioning, yang is treated.

As mentioned earlier, there are six yin organs and six yang organs but in principle no
organ s absolute yin or absolute yang. Each organ has both its structure and its function.
Yin controls with that organ’s structure and yang controls its function. For example,
Kidney's shape, size and structure is controlled by Kidney yin and functioning of Kidney
is controlled by Kidney yang. Kidney is an yin organ but it has both yin and yang.
There are separate points related to kidney yin and to kidney yang.
