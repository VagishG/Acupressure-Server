To Store & Excrete Bile :

Gall Bladder receives refined bile from Liver which it stores and it excrets the bile
when there is need of it for digestion. Liver gives necessary Qi for bile excretion
to Gall Bladder. But when Liver Qiis obstructed then due to improper secretion of
bile from Gall Bladder digestion process of food becomes obstructed. Due to this
stomach capacity of following Qi downward is reduced, by this occurs nausea
and belching. In that case treatment should be of Liver Qi stagnation.

To give capacity of taking decisions :

Liver gives ability for the proper planning of life and Gall Bladder gives ability for
taking decisions. Liver and Gall Bladder both together maintain coordination in
planning and implementation.

In China balanced Gall Bladder has been called big Gall Bladder and deficient
Gall Bladder has been called Small Gall Bladder.

Balanced Gall Bladder gives courage. Deficient Gall Bladder makes timid and
fearful.

Initiative, drive, courage to take decision and make changes from time to time
according to needs is provided by the Gall Bladder. There are two special things
in this, first is that Gall Bladder gives the capacity to take decision for
implementation of any thought and heart gives capacity of involvement after taking
decision for implementation.

So when Gall Bladder becomes deficient then a person becomes timid, he lacks
courage and his decision taking capacity reduces.
