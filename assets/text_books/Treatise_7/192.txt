b) Effects of digestion :
When the flow of liver Qi is normal, then function of digestion by stomach, spleen
is proper and stomach Qi keeps flow in downwards and spleen Qi keeps flowing
upwards. However, if liver Qi flow is obstructed, then it attacks stomach Qi and
stomach Qi's downwards flow gets obstructed and this causes belching, acidity,
vomiting, nausea to the person.
If liver Qi flow is obstructed, then then it attacks spleen Qi and the later's function
of transformation and conversion of food is upset and the person suffers from
diarrhea. This is due to the liver over controlling the spleen.
c) Effects on secretion of bile :
When liver Qiis obstructed then secretion of bile is also effected which causes
problem of pilia [Jaundice], belching and bitter taste in the mouth etc.
Liver controls muscles and tendons:
The ability of a person to work, walk etc depends on the status of his muscles and
tendons. The operation of joints depends on the contraction\relaxation of muscles and
tendons. The ability of contraction\relaxation of muscles and tendon is depends on the
capability of liver blood in moisturing and nourishing.
Ifliver blood is adequate, then muscles and tendons moisture and nourishment takes
place properly and the joints keep functioning well and the person is able to walk and
run properly.
When liver blood is deficient and the moisturing and nourishing of muscles and tendons
is improper, then the function of joints gets badly effected and the person feels difficulty
in walking and moving properly and feels pain in stretching\contracting limbs and gets
cramps \spasm in muscles and tendons, [tremor] teteny, numbness and problem of
lack of strength in arms legs.
“When liver Qi declines, semens can not move”
Apart from this, due to liver’s internal wind, muscles and tendons get contraction and
tremors causing twitching and convulsion.
