Ifthe symptoms appear gradually and change slowly they indicate a yin condition.
If yang is normal, the things will be kept moving, Qi will flow normally and fluids
will be transformed and excreated normally.

Ityangis deficient, Qi stagnates, fluids are not transformed or excreted. Therefore,
yin will prevail.

Thus yang keeps things moving and in a state of fluidity or non substantality.
When yin prevails, the movement and transformation power of yang fails. The
energy condenses into form and it becomes substantial.

For example, when yang Qi moves properly in stomach, then intestines also
properly function. Food is digested properly intestines absorb the nutritive part
properly and excrete waste products â€” stool and urine properly. If yang energy is
depleted or is not functioning properly. Then digestion and excretion part is
obstructed. Circulation of body fluids in blood reduces and first, obstruction in
blood happens and finally nodes are formed in the body.

The Yin & Yang organs are very different in their functions.
But they depend on each other for the performance of their functions.
The Yin organs depend on the Yang organs to produce Qi and blood from food.

The Yang organs depend on the Yin organs for nourishment deriving from blood
& essence stored in Yin organs.
