Treatment of Stomach Diseases in Chinese Acupuncture :

There are four main functions of Stomach :

1) Digestion of food.

2) Descend mixture of food in Small Intestine.

3) To flow the Qi downward from upward in body.

4) Towork as the source of body fluids in the body.

Rotting and ripening is the function of Stomach so that Spleen could absorb the extract
of the food in body by separating it from food.

“The middle burners in the Stomach ............0. and controls the rotting and ripening of
food and drinks.”

Stomach Meridian

(Chapter 31 of the ‘Classics of Difficulties’)

So mostly diseases of the Stomach are related with digestion. Controller of the middle
warmer of the body are stomach and spleen. Middle warmer is the centre of the energy
pathway of the body, from here energy is flowing upward and downward Stomach Qi flows
downward from upward.

Stomach Qi does the impartment function of descending food from upward in Gastro
Intestinal Tract (GIT). Spleen Qi flows from downward to upper centre in the body. Spleen
separating the extract from digested food, forming blood etc. from that sands it to Lungs
and Heart.

When Stomach Qi stagnated there becomes retention of food because Stomach does
the function of sending food downward in digestive tract.

Man receives the Qi by two sources. First prenatal Qi are preheaven Qi which is
called inborn energy and second post natal or post heaven Qi that is call post heaven Qi
that is call post heaven Qi. We receive this post heaven Qi from Stomach and Spleen.
Stomach and Spleen are the sources of post heaven Qi in body. Stomach and Spleen both
together are called root of post heaven Qi.

Chinese Acupuncture gives most importance to Stomach Qi and it has been considered
as Root Qi, prognosis of a disease is done by checking the Stomach Qi.

“If there is Stomach Qi, there is life and if there is no Stomach Qi, there is death.”
