From the above it may be seen that cold dry is earth element and if in this dry is
Teplaced by wet, then this with be converted to water. Cold wet is water element. Due
to change of weather, hotness, coldness, dryness and hotness varies (increases /
decreases) and so also variation takes place in the element's status in the body. By
the type of food also that one takes, Hotness, Coldness, Dryness and Wetness
increases / decreases. In Egypt also, treatment is done based on a different four
element principles.
