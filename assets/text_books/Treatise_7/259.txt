Liver controls the Stomach and Spleen:

In degradation and digestion of food, stomach is assisted by Liver.
Spleen transforus the food and moves it forward. As lay as there is
harmony between Liver and Stomach, the digestion process progresses
smoothly. But when liver overacts, then this process is interrupted;
this has been explained in the chapter on Liver under the heading liver
attacking Stomach and Spleen.

Heart Controls Lungs :

The heart sends blood to the lungs. Lungs purify it by adding oxygen in
it. The quantity of blood is controlled by heart. Heart governs blood.
Lungs govern Qi; Qi and blood nourish each other.

Spleen Controls the Kidneys :

Spleen and Kidney both transform the body fluids in the body. The
transformed fluids by spleen are processed by Kidneys and water and
toxins chemicals etc. Therein are excreted from the body in the form of
urine.
