Spleen controls the transformation of food. If the transformation of food and
digestion is not proper, then the therapists attention should go to spleen.

will have varicose veins, piles, hernia etc.

Heart heat flows downwards where it meets kidney coldness. In the same way,
kidney coldness flows upwards and meets Heart heat.

Actually, heart supplies heat to the body. This heat is sent through blood up to the
kidneys. Kidneys provide coldness to the body. This function is performed by
kidneys by increasing water element in the body. Therefore, to ensure harmony
between heat and coldness in the body so that its temperature is maintained at
98.4Â°F, Heart and Kidneys together perform this function.

Any obstruction in the above functioning of Heart and Kidney, results in diseases.
These diseases can be cured by treatment. Detailed explanation on these is
