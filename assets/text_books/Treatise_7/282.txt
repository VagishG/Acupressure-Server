Qi where deficient, where excess
Where stagnated, where hasit sunk
Leaving the flow path,
Which side has the Qi gone astray
First recognize this, O therapist
Then do the treatment
Diagnose the disease first
Then treat the ailment.

If the Stomach prolapses, if the uterus has a prolapses

If the Intestines have hernia, if the anus prolapses

If the urinary Bladder has prolapsed, if the anus vaginal prolapses

When there is piles, if there is varicose veins

If there is any prolapsed anywhere

Ifincontinence of any type starts

If mental depression starts

Inall these, treatment is needed become Qi has sunk.
Burp, hiccups, nausea, vomiting
When diarrohea does take place
Stomach Qi has contravection
This needs treatment from thou.

If simultaneously with diarrhoea

Prolapse also has taken place

This is a contravection of Spleen Qi

And needs treatment from thou.
With cold and cough
If asthma also takes place
Itis indicative of contravection of Lungs Qi
And needs treatment from thou.

If only Asthma takes place

But no coughing

Itis contravection of Kidney Qi

And needs treatment from thou.
