If there is night-fall, it indicates that due to kidney yin deficiency, empty fire has
increased and it is causing sexy dreams and then spermatorrhoea. In such a
case kidney yin should be treated but if spermatorrhoea takes place in sleep
without any dreams, then it shows that kidney Qiis sinking.
In the night, there is excess of Yin Qi because night is yin (an day is yang), but
when in the night, yang Qi starts sinking, then the patient has frequent urge for
urination.
The fundamental cause of kidney Qi sinking in frequent masturbation. In ladies,
more child births also leads to kidney Qi sinking.
