Somewhere sometimes fluid reduces

Somewhere sometimes fluid increases

When increases, oedema occurs

Sometimes its retention occurs

Sometimes its incontinence occurs

Sometimes it becomes phlegm

Sometimes it becomes semi solid fluid

Sometimes it stagnates in meridian

Sometimes it is obstructed in Heart
Where has it reduced, where increased
Where has it appeared as swelling
Where has it obstructed where suck,
Where has it appeared at phlegm
Where has it appeared at clot
Where has it appeared at a node
Where has it become like stone
Where has it appeared as arthritis
Where has it stuck as gout
Where has its retention taken place
Where has its continence take place

And then treat it.
