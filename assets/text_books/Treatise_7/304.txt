Somewhere sometimes if blood reduces
Somewhere sometimes if blood increases
Somewhere sometimes if blood has blockage
Somewhere sometimes if blood warms up
Somewhere sometimes if bleeding starts
Where it increases and where it reduces
Where has it blockage
Where has it become warm
Where has it started bleeding
You understand it first
You treat it thereafter
You diagnose the ailment first
You treat it thereafter
When blood reduces in Liver
Then menstruation fluid also reduces
When blood is block in Liver
Then menstruation becomes painful
When energy reduces in Spleen
Blood does not stop in vessels
Haemorrhage occurs
And bleeding starts
Insomnia when troubles you
Sleep when it comes and with dreams
And startles at every thing
Heart blood deficiency needs treatment.
When pain happens in Heart region
And expands upto the left arm
Lips and nails turn blackish
This shows blood stagnation in Heart
