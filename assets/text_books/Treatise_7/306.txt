3) Body Fluids causing Phlegm :
Mainly Spleen deficiency causes phlegm â€” When spleen is unable to transform and
transport body fluids, then these body fluids become phlegm. Lungs and kidney also
act to form phlegm. When lungs are unable to send body fluids downwards, then
phlegm is formed in the lungs. And when kidney is unable to evacuate body fluids
outside the body, then these body fluids get collected in the body in the form of phlegm.

Phlegm is of two types :

i)  Phlegm having a form

ii) Phlegm without a form

i) Phlegmhavinga form:

Itis that phlegm which one can see e.g., the one that comes out of Lungs. This is

temoved during coughing by spitting out. Lungs are most effected by this. Phlegm

is of the flowing types.

a) White phlegm

b) Yellow or green phlegm

c) Thin like watery phlegm

a) White Phlegm :
When Spleen Qi deficiency or spleen yang deficiency takes place, transfor-
mation and transportation of body fluids and fatty foods like ghee, oil and
other fatty foods stops; this results in formation of phlegm. And when phlegm
stops in lungs, the patient feels inconvenience in sleeping on his back and
lots of white phlegm keeps coming out with cough. This is called accumula-
tion of white phlegm in lungs and this is an acute condition.
