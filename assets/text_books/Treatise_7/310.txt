Essence

1)

Essence is of three types :
1) Obtained at birth
2) Obtained during life time
3) InKidneys
Obtained at birth :
This is obtained as the time of birth as fate from God. This determines a person's
constitution, life force and the period of life etc. This essence is in every organ of the
person, and it can be made active by the organ-source point. This essence cannot be
increased. Disciplined life, balanced food and work-rest balance etc. can improve the
quality of this pre-heaven essence.
By treating at the following organ-source points, life essence and original Qi can be
made more active and the organ’s functioning can be made more balanced. By treating
at the yin-organ source points, yin organs are tonified and by treating at the yang
organ source points, pathogenic factors are expelled out of the body and yang organs
are balanced. In acute problems of yang organs, treating at the related organ source
point brings relief.
