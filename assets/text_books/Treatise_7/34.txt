@ — Stagnation of Qi causes heaviness but less pain; also pain is not localized.

@ — Stasis of blood causes sharp pain like needle piercing and localized at specific
point

@ The table given above should be carefully studied and diagnose the type of pain
and whether it is excess/deficient/cold or hot type? For example, if after motion
pain increases in anus, it indicates deficiency of Qi in large intestine. In such a
case, by toning large intestine, relief will come.

@ = If after motion, pain reduces in the anus, it indicates excess of energy in large
intestine and so sedation will give relief. Similarly, by vomiting, if stomach pain
reduces, then it means stomach Qi excess or stomach heat excess; their treatment

will ensure oure the diseases from roots. er BY ye? x we
