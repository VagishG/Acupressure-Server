In Chinese Acupuncture, the state of organs inside the body, the state of Qi, Blood,
Yin & Yang and the constitution of the patient are diagnosed by his/ her pulse.

pulse is examined by placing three fingers, near the wrist, on the radial artery at three
places. These three locations are front, middle & rear positions.
