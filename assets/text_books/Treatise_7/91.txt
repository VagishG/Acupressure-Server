The conception vessel provides Qi to the uterus.
The Chong Mai vessel provides blood to the uterus.

The conception vessel and the Chong Mai vessel both depend on the state of
Kidneys. If the Kidney essence is abundant, the conception vessel and Chong
Maiare strong. Hence, the uterus is supplied with the adequate Qi and blood. So
there willbe normal menstruation and pregnancy. If the Kidney essence is weak,
the conception vessel and Chong Mai will be empty. Hence, the uterus does not
get adequate supply of Qi and blod. So, there will be irregular menstruation,
amenorrhoea or infertility.

Relation between the uterus and the blood is very close.

The uterus relies on the abundant supply of blood at all times.
The heart governs the blood.

The Liver stores the blood.

The Spleen controls the blood.

Ifthe Spleen does not produce enough blood, the heart becomes deficient. This
will cause a lack of blood in the uterus. This may result in amenorrhoea.
