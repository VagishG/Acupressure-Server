Marrow:

Marrow nourishes brain and spinal cord. Marrow also forms bone marrow.

“The refined essence of food changes into fat and enters the bone cavities and fills the
brain with marrow.”

(Chapter 36 of ‘Spiritual Axis)’

The marrow originates from the kidney essence. if the kidneys are deficient the marrow
is also deficient.
© Kidney essence deficiency causes shortage of marrow. it in turn causes poor

bone nourishment. The bones become soft, weak and there is lack of calcium in
teh bones. The teeth become loose. There is shortage of marrow in the brain.
The adults become mentally dull with poor memory. The children become mentally
retarded with poor growth of bones. In both cases there is hair fall or premature
greying of hair.

By looking the condition of teeth9 condition of bones inside the body may be
known. By looking hair condition of kidney essence can be known. Give treatment
here in deficiency of cerebro spinal fluid.
