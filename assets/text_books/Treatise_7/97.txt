The Six Stages of Diseases & The Six Channel Axes
(A Florilegium of Acupuncture Therapy)

Zhang Jing, a learned Acupuncturist of China, in his book “Treatise on Febrile and
Miscellaneous Diseases”, has defined six stages of diseases. He says that diseases enter
the body from two causes:

i) Diseases due to external causes

ii) Diseases due to internal causes

When the diseases enter the body due to external bad effects, then first of all, the
disease appears in the form of fever. If treatment is not done in the time then the disease will
penetrate deeper & deeper. In the body, the fever has six special stages. In the first stage,
the fever enters inside by passing the skin & in the last day the six stage, the fever penetrating
deeply in the body attacks the internal organs.
