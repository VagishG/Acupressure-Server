Pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy :

(i) It is a group of muscular dystrophies characterised by enlargement
(pseudo hypertrophy) of muscles most commonly known as Backers mus-
cular dystrophy. It has a late onset and slowly progressive course, trans-
mitted as an X-linked recessive trait.

(ii) Duchennes muscular dystrophy :

It is most common & severe types of pseudohypertrophic muscular dys-
trophy. It begins in early childhood, it is chronic & progressive, is charac-
terised by increasing weakness in the pelvic & shoulder girdles, pseudo-
hypertrophy of muscles followed by atrophy, lordosis, and a peculiar swing-
ing gait with legs kept wide apart.

(iii) Emery-dreipess muscular :

It a rare X-linked form of muscular destrophy begining early in life and
involving slowly progressive weakness of the upper arm & pelvic girdle
muscles, with cardiomypathy & flexion contractures of the elbows, mus-
cles are not hypertrophied.

Facio scapulo humeral muscular dystrophy:

A relatively benign form of muscular destrophy with marked atrophy of the

muscles of the face, shoulder girdle and arm.

Limbgirdie muscular dystrophy:

It is slowly progressive muscular destrophy, usually begining in childhood,

marked by weakness & wasting of the pelvic girdle (scapulo humeral muscu-

lar dystrophy)

Other forms of Muscular Dystrophy:

Mytonotic dystrophy:

It is a rare slowly, progressive, hereditary disease, marked by mytonia, fol-
lowed by muscular atrophy (especially of the face & neck, cataracts, hypogo-
nadism, frontal balding and cardiac disorders.

Oculopharyngeal destrophy :

It is a form with onset in adult life, characterised by weakness of the external
ocular & pharyngeal muscles that causes:
