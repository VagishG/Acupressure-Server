| Depression

According to Chinese Acupuncture, the depression is of six types :

vy)

vi)

Qi depression
Blood depression
Phlegm depression
Damp depression
Heat depression
Food depression

“If the human body's Qi and blood are penetrating and harmonious, the tens of thou-
sands of diseases can not be engendered. If one's wishes are thwarted and one is
depressed, various diseases are engendered. Therefore, the diseases of the human
body are mostly engendered by depression".

If the emotions are abnormal, they will affect the Qi mechanism.
Qi diseases eventually affect the blood.
Then Qi & blood both become diseased. This causes many diseases.

In all six types of mental depression, apart from various mental symptoms one
or more of physical symptoms also appear, which helps to diagnose the type of
depression.
