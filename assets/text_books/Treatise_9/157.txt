Assertiveness means clearly expressing your own thoughts & feelings.

Receptiveness means listening to the other person without interrupting & trying to accept
his thought. There should be a balance between Assertiveness & Receptiveness. There
should also be balance between concern for yourself & concern for others.

You messages are for balancing the other person. For example : you should, you
should not. dact 7 et Ye Message & Waa #1 For example : You do like this.
