3. Social phobia :
Social phobia is phobia of functions & not of objects or situations.

The person fears embarrasment or hermiliation in a social gathering or meeting in
which the person feels that he might be looked at critically. Such fear provokes anxiety &
the person does not attend the function or meeting.

In all types of phobias, the fear is imaginary. The object feared is real. The
situation feared is also real. This imaginary fear must be diluted by behaviour therapy.

Hydrophobia : It is dog madness.
