Carbuncle (arR)

An extensive abscess of the skin and deeper tissues usually occuring on the back,
nape of the neck and shoulders where the tissues are weakened, and is generally associated
with diabetes. In later stages the abscess bursts allowing the purulent discharge to come
out through several openings in the skin and so the carbuncle becomes sieve like or cribriform
in appearance which is its characteristic feature.
