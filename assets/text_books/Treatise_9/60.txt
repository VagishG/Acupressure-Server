It weighs about three pounds i.e. 2% of total body weight.

In adults it consumes 20% of total oxygen supply to the body.
In children it consumes 50% of total oxygen supply to the body.
1/5 of body's blood flows through the brain.

1/2 point of blood flows through the brain every minute.

Nerve cells depend on the energy provided by blood sugar.
Modest Quantity of sugar is stored in the brain.

If the blood flows to the brain is interrupted the brain losses conciousnes within
a few second and the brain starts deteriorating within a few minute of such
interruptions.

The surface of the brain is called cortex. It is 1/8" thick & contain 10 billion to
100 billion nerve cells.

The brain has a storage capacity of at least 10° (ten billion kilobytes). This
capacity is equivalent to 10,000 encyclopedias.

The brain radiats energy equivalent to 25 watt light bulb.

Alpha waves are low frequency waves producing relaxations so these are called
relaxation waves.

Beta waves are low frequency waves producing tension. So these are called
tension waves.

Left brain generates much beta waves & less alpha waves.

Right brain generates much alpha waves & less beta waves.

The well balanced brain has a natural 90 minute cycle called ultradian rhythm.
During waking hours the brain produces beta waves of alertness. But after every
90' the brain shifts to alpha wave activity for a few minuts to allow rest.
Swing sleep the brain shifts every 90' from delta wave state & deep sleep toa
lighter sleep (REM sleep), allowing dreams to occur. Dreams are essential to
essential health.
