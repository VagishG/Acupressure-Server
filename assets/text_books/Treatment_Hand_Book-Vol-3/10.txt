Reflex Arc

1) Definition : It may be defined as an involuntary response to a stimulus
2) Itconsist of :
Areceptor organ: situated in skin , muscles , or tendon

An afferent neuron : the cell body is located in the posterior root ganglion and
the central axon of the first order neuron

An effector neuron
An effector organ
3) Fivesteps:

Arrival of stimulus and activation of receptor

Activation of sensory neuron
Information processing
Activation of motor neuron
Response by effector

Five Steps of Reflex Arc

STEP 2:

Activation of a
‘sensory neuron

‘STEP 4:

Activation of a
motor neuron
