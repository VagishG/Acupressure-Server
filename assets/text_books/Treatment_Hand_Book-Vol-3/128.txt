Parietal Lobe - Cortical Regions

i) Primary Somatosensory Cortex (Postcentral Gyrus) :
Site involved with processing of tactile and proprioceptive information.
ii) Somatosensory Association Cortex :
Assists with the integration and interpretation of sensations relative to body
position and orientation in space. May assist with visuo-motor coordination.
iii) Primary Gustatory cortex :
Primary site involved with the interpretation of the sensation of Taste.

Lobes of Brain - Occipital Lobe

i) The Occipital Lobe of the Brain is located
deep to the Occipital Bone of the Skull

ii) ts primary function is the processing,
integration, interpretation, etc. of VISION
and Visual Stimuli.

Occipital Lobe - Cortical Regions

i) Primary Visual Cortex:
This is the primary area of the brain
responsible for sight recognition of size,
colour, light, motion, dimensions etc.

ii) Visual Association Area:
Interprets information acquired through
the primary visual cortex.
