Note :- Homunculus literally means "little person". and may refer to one whose body
shape is governed by the cortical area devoted to the body region.

The Pre central (motor) area :
Lies in frontal lobe anterior to the central sulcus.
The cells initiate contraction of skeletal muscles.

Motor area of right cerebrum controls voluntary muscle movements of left side
of body and vice versa.

The size of area of cortex is proportional to complexity of movement of body
parts.

Example: Your hands require many intricate movements and sensations to function
properly. This requires a great deal of cortical surface area to control these
detailed actions. Your back is quite the opposite, requiring limited cortical
area to carry out its actions and functions, or detect sensation.
