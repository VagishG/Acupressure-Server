THE BASAL GANGLIA OR BASAL NUCLEI

Basal ganglia/Nuclei Comprise multiple subcortical nuclei, of varied origin, in

the brains of vertebrates, which are situated at the base of the forebrain. Basal
ganglia nuclei are strongly interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and
brainstem, as well as several other brain areas. The basal ganglia are associated
with a variety of functions including: control of voluntary motor movements,
procedural learning, routine behaviors or "habits" such as bruxism (unconsciously
clenching the teeth) eye movements, cognition and emotion.
The main components of the basal ganglia — as defined functionally — are the dorsal
striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen),ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens
and olfactory tubercle), globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra,
and subthalamic nucleus.

The striatum

The largest component of the basal ganglia. The term "striatum" comes from
the observation that this structure has a striped appearance when sliced in certain
directions, arising from numerous large and small bundles of nerve fibers (white
matter) that traverse it. Early anatomists, examining the human brain, perceived the
striatum as two distinct masses of gray matter separated by a large tract of white
matter called the internal capsule. They named these two masses the "caudate
nucleus" and “putamen”.

Subthalamic nucleus

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a diencephalic gray matter portion of the
basal ganglia, and the only portion of the ganglia that produces an excitatory
neurotransmitter, glutamate. The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the
SNr-GPi complex and it is part of the indirect pathway. The subthalamic nucleus
receives inhibitory input from the external part of the globus pallidus and sends
excitatory input to the GPi.
