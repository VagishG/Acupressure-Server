ii) The movements of the muscle and joints.

Sensory Disturbances

SYRINGOMYELIA:

Involving the Grey Matter round to the central canal of the spinal cord in which

excessive growth of neuroglial tissue occur with cavity formation.

Characteristic Features :

i) Loss of pain and temperature sense

ii) Touch senseis retained.

iii) At the level of lesion initially gliosis and cavitation spread and involve the ant.
Horn cells producing paralysis of muscles (usually hand).

TABES DORSALIS:

Syphilis of the spinal cord characterized by degeneration of sensory neurons and

stabbing pains in the trunk and legs and unsteady gait and incontinence and

importance.
