DISSEMINATED SCLEROSIS:

A chronic progressive nervous disorder involving loss of myelin sheath around

certain nerve fibers.

Characteristic Feature :

i) Demylinated disease of CNS which produce sensory and motor disturbances.

demylinated axons.

iii) Sign and symptoms manifest account to the ascending and descending
pathway involved.

This condition is associated with demylination of white fibers of the spinal cord

affecting in the dorsal columns and later lateral columns.
