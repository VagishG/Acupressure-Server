The Behavior of Organisms:

Multicellular animals have nervous systems that generate behavior. Nervous
systems are formed from specialized cells that conduct signals rapidly through
the long cell extensions that make up nerves. The nerve cells communicate
with each other by secreting specific excitatory and inhibitory molecules. In
sense organs, specialized cells detect light, sound, and specific chemicals and
enable animals to monitor what is going on in the world around them.
Organisms have behavioral responses to internal changes and to external
stimuli. Responses to external stimuli can result from interactions with the
organism's own species and others, as well as environmental changes; these
responses either can be innate or learned. The broad patterns of behavior
exhibited by animals have evolved to ensure reproductive success. Animals
often live in unpredictable environments, and so their behavior must be flexible
enough to deal with uncertainty and change. Plants also respond to stimuli.

Like other aspects of an organism's biology, behaviors have evolved through
natural selection. Behaviors often have an adaptive logic when viewed in terms
of evolutionary principles.

Behavioral biology has implications for humans, as it provides links to
psychology, sociology, and anthropology.
