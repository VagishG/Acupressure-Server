e The Brain Stem forms the link between the Cerebral cortex, white matter & the
spinal cord.

e Beneath the cortex , within the white matter is found the Basal Ganglia includ
ing the caudate nucleus, putamen & globus pallidus- all involved in movement
control.

e —_Limbic system forms connections with cerebral cortex, white matter & brain
stem. It is deep within the temporal lobes. It is involved in Mood, emotions,
appetite, anxiety etc.

White matter is a general term referring to:

e Large axon tracts in the brain and spinal cord
White matter is formed by Axons entering and leaving the cortex of :

e Thecerebral hemispheres

e  Thecerebellum

e The hippocampus

e@ — Itforms 60% of total brain volume

Brain has two cell types :

1. Neurons- consist of cell body with two projections — axons & dendrites.
Itreceives, processes & transmits information through synapses (‘nerve joints’).

2. Glialcells- smaller than neurons with no projections (ground tissue / matrix).
They play supporting role in :

e Maintaining signalling ability of neurons
e Modulating rate of nerve impulse propogation.
e Controlling uptake of neurotransmitters.

Why Grey and Why White Colour ?

The White matter consists of axons :

e — Itappears white because of fatty material myelin.

e The myelin sheath insulates the axon.

The Grey matter consists of :

e —Cellbodies with dendrites.

e _ Iteffectively connects to other cell bodies and dendrites.

e _ Itis the cytoplasm of nerve cells - hence appears Grey.
