Therefore, energy can't be said to be formless.
In respect to human body, as long as energy
(Atma, Chetna, Urja) is there, so long the human being is alive.
In Ayurved the Shloka about Energy / Atma states :
Rito: recor aeayeryonae: |

The supreme self is deviod of abnormalities, is the cause of consciousness with

the conjunction of mind, properties of bhutas and sense organs, is eternal and
seer who sees all the actions. [56].

The Shloka about the In-Seperableness of Physical and Metaphysical states :
waareasygersrat yea yotsta: 1

Samavaya (inherence) is the inseparableness of prithvi etc. (dravya) with their
gunas (properties). This is eternal because no dravya (substance) is devoid of
property. [50].
In the above Shloka, the properties of the five physical components of the human
body i.e.
Non resistance of Akash

Mobility of Vayu
Burning of Agni
Cooling of Jal
Hardness of Prithvi

are possible only as a result of Samvaya or Togetherness of Physical and
Metaphysical.

“Else the Dravyas / Elements shall be energyless or A-Chetna / Non-living’.
