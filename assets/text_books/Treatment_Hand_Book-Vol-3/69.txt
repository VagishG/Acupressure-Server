â€˜Ayus' means the conjunction of body, sense organs, mind and self and is known
by the synonyms dhazi, jivita, nityoga and anubandha. [42].
Hence whenever

A substance is together with Energy, it is called Living else the substance is said
to be Non-Living.

space are dravyas (substances). Dravya having sense organ is sentient while
that without it is insentient. [48].
