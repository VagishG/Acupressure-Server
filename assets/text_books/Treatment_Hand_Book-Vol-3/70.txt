The evolution of Cosmos / 10 Origin :

The '0' is the big cosmic energy.
All subsequent energies i.e. 1-9 are from it.

Before this cosmos came into existence, a loud sound appeared (as per the
big bang theory).

This first Bhoot ‘Shabd’ = Akash is manifested as the various zones of
atmosphere (Layers).

Akash is the envelope of gases, covering the earth.
Between Sky and the Earth are innumerable dancing particles.

Here arises the second origin - Vanaspati / Plants which are innumerous,
spread over a wide expanse.

Plants = Woods (forests) - Another form of life process viz Amoeba

and Fungi.

After suitable environment, the first primitive form - Amoeba appeared.
Evolution sarted as :

Gases —> Liquid —> Solid

Hence after Vayu / Wind ... the Agni origin or the genesis of Purush comes
into existence.

It depicts dominance of metabolism, temperature, metamorphosis (changes)
in life processes.

Origin '3' branch (Ten Origins of Agni / Living forms):

The gases evaporate and condense to form liquid / rain and the origin of
fourth element water appears.

It collects down forming well, ponds, lakes, streams, streamlets, canals,
